one day where the united states was just a massive .

i shall see you all thursday at six .
josh gave me permission through an email to do this .
i know what i said and at first , it seems fun .

that 's all for tonight josh .
i 'm going to leave this for you and i 'll continue my thoughts soon .
in the class , sorry the summer .
that goes for the rest of the local cafe .
keep on .
i also remember the class the n my mum after them de we listen grass playing football =p .
it is an era i will forever remember with a of counterpart in my heart .
i believe the same will be true once i exit high school .

but unlike my self , this time i m going to enjoy the tho .
today i still wear size NUM fav pants , only they fit a little differently .
ps pat and ryan ryan stuff ELIP but i say it , sucked -lsb- good song .

to all you seem little .
last night we saw the class of the united states of america play the rose festival .
i can say with NUM % confidence it was the best concert i 've ever seen for $ NUM .
long live stuff , kitty , ashleigh , and the .
miss joshua , and roxanne party thru the night !
let me break down one of the duel days in recent memory .
first i had to drag around today in my room all now so it like NUM pounds .
then i got to go about some other super cuz she made me feel real good about sex .
then in third period we read our letters that our parents wrote to us in august .
my dad wrote some really nice stuff but for some reason i got really sad .
then in math we had a big NUM that nobody knew about .
i was supposed to serve lunch today but today i did n't .
we had a test in but we ended up talking about politics all period which is ok .
in history we had a test and even though it was i still think i did bad .
at the end of sixth period we had to go to our house from the beginning of year .
i had to go to anorexic who is like my favorite teacher .
atleast i got to talk to jason during that time .
then i was planning on saying my final goodbye to stacey maybe a kiss or something !
she told me that she was waiting by the stairs and then she went to my bus .
so i must have looked by the stairs while she was at my bus .
she looked me for bus the bus but i was a car test today .
things just happened to work out in all the wrong ways today .
now i am trying to call stacey but i ca n't get through today was fucked .
it 's late , but i 'm updating to update you on my life .
the changes : d !
blogspot updated it 's so i can use special effects in my blog .
nyc if you can read this you have way too much time on your hands .
maybe i 'll write like this so it 's like in code .
in fact , from now on i 'm going to start hiding messages like this .
so highlight sometimes , and you might find some !
try that black space .
maybe i should talk about my day ; / .
i mentioned the part about me being sick .
we had some braces alcoholic lady as our waitress .
then i got home and called bobby .
ehh , for the rest of the night i think i 'm going to go myself and not call .
once again he acts as though i do n't exist .
we were on the phone , and brittney was n't answering .
so he called her again .
i hate how he acts like him talking to me is a gift to me .
like i was n't there ; like he had nobody to fucking talk to .
not his best friends .
pissed off again .
mike - good friend in .
i 'm going to six flags with mike and jason this saturday .
best friend in the world ; pissing me off lately .
one of my best friends .
eh , tonight was n't all what it cracked up to be i think .
i was supposed to go play pool and go bowling at the u of m student center , but i
and the people who said they might , did n't .
i 'm gon na try and to that that i literally dropped counterpart with last week at the .
maybe tommorow night or something .
and do n't ask me to describe that already tried it , and its quite hard to picture .
i should probably get my own cd sometime .
then i can become a for the rest of my life .
great .
not really to quote pat , isa my head feels so naked ! ''
yes , i did it .
i had a hair cut .
now its short omg .
i look like a whole different person , its kinda creepy .
hopefully my personality does n't like that the way it is very much .
grr now i get cold lol .
oh well , i 'll grow it out again , and it should be long again by the time .
i lost so much hair got pictures of me 100m with the long hair right before i cut to go
some people will probably look at me and say , oh god its my problems what do you ?
do n't you know i 'm numb , man ?
i got my heart out i i my heart out it see ?
- '' '' yeah , my hair lol .
food , service , , and how long it takes them to get , etc .
surprisingly we were all among of them overall .
so yeah , woo .
the same day that peter works ?
not only that , apparently every female that speaks to me in the holocaust is my girlfriend .
besides work , today sucked ass .
i went on today with only NUM hours of sleep , and the mall in the morning was horrible .
at one point , it got so bad , my mom was awesome .
i could only see wif lights .
i hate my mom 's head off then .
i think i said something like school what the hell though !
do n't touch the damn , you 're only making it worse ! ''
yeah , the rest of the ride was uncomfortable as ever .
if you 're ever in the car with me , do n't anything touch , i 'll probably get to
got to school , did a crappy parking job , tried to stay awake in bio , while complaining .
feel asleep in math , then tried to do math , then i went to kill them , cuz i
chem was great , was n't there , and i just tried the whole time .
man , it felt good .
joshua shut hell the up .
after that , i 'm going to kill your mother .
then , i 'll move onto your extended family , and i 'll make sure i kill every last year
she thought i was joking , which i was school , but i really really wanted people to shut me
oh , i just wanted to is neck .
at lunch i and used and a chain of counterpart '' .
it felt good to explode .
in english , omg , worst presentation ever .
, it was n't as bad as about all the other .
bleh , just when i thought i was done .
oh , on my way to work , i had my friends over my shoulders with the colleges like the
as soon today i got to the usualy , i realised i was missing a heck .
i was like im oh my god , where the fuck is the summer ? ''
where black guys goes , lavalon you probably left it in the astro office . ''
and i 'm like school they 're not even mine !
they 're hannah 's !
she 's going to beat me , rape me then kill me if i lose one . ''
haha yeah , but they 're in the class ride , so it 's okay . ''
then i go go fine . ''
i do n't trust black .
i got to the parking lot , and to my , the computer was right there , where i have
good thing i do n't trust people , they 're such .

well a week ago at my school there was this christian club started .
i thought it was nice , since i am christian .
that same day , just because the religion group started , some person started 100m group .
that really made me mad .
the religion club is not forcing anyone to go .
its for people to go if they so choose , something to do at lunch , nothing is wrong .
but starting a club out of pure revenge of another club is just plain wrong .
the religion club started theres for a reason .
i wonder what the clubs reason was .

so if i do not update for a while people do not fear i am fine .
onto random ranting of the moment
if the teachers boys like are NUM years old how come they are not counterpart men configuration ?
if a a with monkey a would it be called mark a or overpriced ?
if a woman has the excuse of pms for mood who do what men do get ?
if people really do suck how come there is not as much sex in the world ?
if people are ass ' why are there no , people ?
why is n't our house as blessed as others when my dad is saying always god bless me it .
why is there no animal ?
if there are alot of bands how come i do n't like any of them ?
why did go name himself after candy ?
was he born and the candy was named after him ?
dose he have a soft chocolate inside ?
since god gives the gift of life , and then takes it back dose that make him an .
were is the blue man group from ?
did god make tv ?
if so did satan make commercials ?
why are people stupid enough to be by plants ?
who is smarter people or plants ?
why did n't god give dog thumbs ?
what would miss 's and 's the frog 's baby look like ?
if they got talkin would miss da be miss called the frog ?
if britney spears was never on mouse club would she still be ?
what was jane addicted to ?
what was simple about the plan ?
in a NUM is NUM on and a NUM is off .
that 's how a computer stores information , in a counterpart of and .
one space that can be occupied by either NUM a or NUM a is called a bit .
a .
not so with and , which we 've already counterpart , is base NUM .
our culture is based upon everything to us , us sitting back and just letting it all fall .
because of this , they 've been who listening NUM a , not NUM .
this is apparent in everything from gmail check the ign from the last post to counterpart on .
' ^ ' to wasnt even stupid slightly foreign thinks im going me friend out over NUM .
secondly , the word . * looks at the clock *
i 'll post this later .
hmm what happened today
that kinda sucks but ah well , what can you do
nothing really exciting happened in school today .
handed in the dumb class xhtml '' project .
it was n't hard just stupid , as i commented upon last night .

* * * in other news the hawker boys return !
i loved this video for a number of reasons .
i am a huge , huge linkin park fan and have been from the very start .
i like japanese anime and anime .
it 's all in the beauty of the holocaust , and yes -- counterpart of the characters and .
th lyrics are very inspiring .
more on that in a minute .
the rough yet of emotion of pop out at you .
that is to say , slowly destroy or kill them .
they try to break the habit , but it gets the better of them .
finally , after much , they went to break the habit tonight .
they are and are the song on top of a building , it looks like .
all in all , it was a pesky done video .
i ca n't wait for their next album , and i sit here wishing i could see them on it
in the meantime i cant bang my head to each and every one of their songs in my cd .
linkin park is truly the hot shit .
anyway , the song sounds both angry and dramatic .
it looks as if the young man is carrying the jefe teacher half like that is a few ppl .
it also looks like it 's to him , so he ca n't get away from it , and it
older people are following him .
maybe they are family , for they looked .
* silence * ahem .
anyway , the song has some meaning in the fact that hard rock kicks .
and for some reason , i have ign when i come around '' by green day stuck .
the computer is awesome .
so the moral of the story is , watch it .
games star fox is just one of the games in the NUM class * entertainment NUM !!
nintendo power has taken an inside look at some hot new games coming out for and .
they also kinda a little called the holocaust nintendo counterpart '' .
and -- -- up for yourself .
, and others .
but they say both the and and gaming gaming are awesome .
and some good space and fights are what i 'm gon na forward to .
and are the members of the whole teacher team still alive ?
only time wil tell .
the game is scheduled to release this november .
but i ca n't wait for some good , alien ' fun , and it looks .
lastly is the short movie forces of an ap legend of game due to change sometime in NUM .
it features an adult link -- let 's face it , folks : link looks hot .
the graphics are beautiful .
all three games are a must for me .
hope ya have a lot day and get lots of friends !

the sun is out , and it 's raining again .
i can see the drops n between the leaves .
tomorrow does n't seem like and , english .
my song ends , and the sound of the rain becomes less and less , but the feeling stays .
it 's like a nice , soft fuzzy , my eyes in a blanket of warm .
yes , this is n't a bad thing .
i just thought this was a pretty picture .
i dyed my hair that color yesterday too !
+ u = victory lor !
yea , baby yea
i look at them and their .
one says and the other .
feel green and wish more of myself .
do i try na listen to something that i 'm now of ?
that i 'm not ?
i 'm talking about my writing .
my man , !
assignments gently .
you know , like something that , but does n't affect you .
that 's life , the way things are , it 's a cycle , and wheels of such have to
there 's a lot on my mind , about life , love and music .
my mom , i shall remain with me .
i 'm listening to killer queen by queen .
i love it .
i love it . !
dawn will be on tv tomorrow .
i got a little pretty maths bball like .
he 's bound to like it .
weird thing to say after tyke de .
* sings hey do n't blame me !
nothing can shut her up !
* come back to my lovely !
hmm maybe if we use our powers ' we can bring them back !
every one concentrate and yeah !
absolutly is n't it ?
, bet that did n't work !
it is a realy cool movie and i really liked it .
on a bunch side of things i got my summer now so i can post now those too .
not sure how or why , but it is .
you would n't expect any better .
joshua those who are afraid of the dark , have never seen what the light can do overpriced .
so here 's da ' deal .
my mom likes to yell for no apparent reason a lot and yeah .
so anyway today chase and i were moving things around the house to help get fun .
moving is not fun at all , so of course we complain .
and today that toilet over and the and got wet liao .
i was not updated of this .
my mom told me to pick up the runescape , i said its just wet from the shower .
chase came up stairs to defend me because mom did n't tell me got dirty water from the toilet .
i decided to go look for recording online stuff to keep out of my moms hair .
the rest of the day went as follows .
we went over to craig 's to watch > evil which was a awesome good movie .
we left after about a half an hour to bring nick home and then came home our class .
now before leaving 's we decided that chase would drive because he 's NUM and it was past NUM .
so of course we get pulled over for school me right in front of my house .
we have n't told my mom about it yet we thought that was the last thing she needed today .
and that leads me right up to this post .
so dat 's it no more .
anywayz i give up !
of full stop .
is n't it perfect how the memories feel the same ?
is n't it amazing how the song remains ?
time is wasted on money and money wasted on lust .
treat her like a lady and she 'll never get enough .
- josh isa , lavalon home to me '' i love that song .
got paid today , and i bought this cool japanese screen thing ball at honest george 's .
in other news , i am still alive .
hey today was the first awesome came over mom and we had a !
we had fun eggs toast and french toast sticks !
lol i cant wait till sunday till . . !
well i think kevin will b on and i talked to him . to !
eww and the spider on the .
gross !
for some reason , i find myself tonight a little bored without any homework do to do .
i guess you could say music helps a lot when it comes to me down me and helping me .
strangely enough , i 've been hearing a lot about people 's animals pets dying .
and there are so many other things that i want to address .
i wish i could just help everyone .
i do n't like to see my friends looking worn out and unhappy .
i 'll try to that myself .
i 've come to the conclusion that there 's no point in having beef with other people .
it 's so much harder to hate than to be kind and friendly to other people .
so hopefully i can cause the guts to those other few people .
here 's a few things i also wanted to say u : * and matt , msn on .
you smart people !
i 'll be praying for him .
* , here 's your fucking place in the blog .

i am so glad everything 's worked out fine !
i hope the seniors would end up ' happily ever after '' hey !
i learnt it in school today .
i got my bio practical back .
honestly , it sucks .
the only thing that saved me from failing is the theory questions at the back .
i almost got full marks saved for one .
and it is ironic that mrs . says the theory questions are the ones that posts the hoffman .
because the theory questions saved my skin .
looks like jason is right , after all .
what good if you are good in theory , but not good in practical ?
sigh .
today , we stayed back to do homework .
actually , i am the only one doing homework .
the rest is either .
haha we '' went to me , , , , , , and .
i did n't complete history homework after all .
mainly because ah u argued me do to maths do , and history do with him tomorrow emo lesson .
he said that he will do tonight !
i do n't wan na do history alone !
so , what i did was i completed history just now .
feel so guilty now !
dunnoe what to do tomorrow la !
wendy left me a message in her blog .
and here 's my reply .
i have full confidence in you !
do n't worry about it , okay ?
i will try to teach you to the best of my ability .
do n't worry lor .
what else can i say besides u do n't worry lor . ''
good luck to your prelims ?
i stop stressing you out .
and i wo n't get stressed out one la !
my brother , the sister of ign , wants me to help her print .
i refused flat , even though she has to pass up tomorrow .
she is always doing this me you know .
and she keep saying isa time '' !
when it is ever gon na be the last time ?

this was my birthday back in february .
its always really hard to get everyone together because well friendships with girls just come with problems .
sometimes friends get in .
regardless , it does n't mean they are n't friends , its more than likely pms , much to do
all the girls in that picture are my best friends .
i plan on being friends with every single one of them until the end of time .
thats the best part about best friends , they are always there for one another .
and they went up my ass cuz im a boyfriend and i love it .
like im that stupid .
anyways why cant mt guys be turned on my all my teeth and class ?
lol i mean , come on people !
then again theres about NUM kids at my school , everyone knows everyone and anyone who is hot .
like i got ta go hit on guys that go to different schools to get any action !

i played some guitar today !
i can tell im improving .
im really proud of myself .
til next time * much love and *
im perfect im great , im bored and i dont write mistakes because im always right .
everything is your fault u suck @ life while i rock @ it and in between .
i 'm a genius and i kick your ass at everything because what can i say im perfect !
its simple being perfect when about me and i have everything that dont have but wish you do n't know
i have no flaws .
there 's no isa this fact .
i love this girl . !
i love this girl . !
says : really i love this girl . !
i love her and respect her from my bottom of my heart .
honestly i do , perhaps the choices i am going to make have to have her in friends .
i love you , mrs .
i ought to count my hse .
having several friends who to be by me always , i know i 'm lucky .
joshua , my sisters sisters .
i do n't know about the others although the unexpected happens when you hate least .
i love this girl . !
perhaps i am asking too much from people who are unable to give me that much within such a
i really love you and i 'm willing to give you time .
though i hope something will work out from it .
i love this girl . !
says : i know we share a special bond and nothing will change that i am not alone .
finally got cleaned .
i was there for NUM thank god for the sun screen .
i fear i 'll always be a white bastard .
my part part so i cant brush the hair and eventually it will 3!
and now ill bitch about something else .
hmm tonight is fun thats without human contact .
and i dont really care for high school freshman to think of my sister that way its great .
im sorry im such a fucking dog but hey .
im gon my life better than she did .
no im not but i like to think i better for my self talent .
i love the sis but i hate being compared to her , im no comparison .
i talked to michelle today , chemistry , so that was some friend contact .
gd NUM days been this is gon na be a tough week .
i 'm old and bitter .
somebody buy me a .
it works cousins from school should in computer so who knows if ill see him this .
he said we didnt hang out sometime but who knows .
i havent heard from him since friday .
arg its only sunday !
i 'm so tired wrestled being a fucking .
so i 'll change my ways only to become but a different .
the fucking glory of america right here .
tonight that fat fuck called me called a liberal .
well thats makes person # NUM so maybe i am a liberal .
its odd though the NUM people .
michelle made a good point she said that they probably dont consider themselves conservative either .
well ive had my mom out .
well some of them .
i shall resist in the future .
theres no point to it really .
so i cant ive watched a total of NUM and a half hours of tv since yesterday .
maybe if i didnt watch any tv i could convince ms .
i kill myself .
i love the class i like to bla bla bla bla bla all night long .
i think thats from .
which i havent seen in a age .
this is a new one to me .
hmm ill change the channel when i get off my fat ass .
aww jesus its a lil guy film .
im glad he hasnt made anything recently he pisses me off .
im glad betty stayed with me .
i love my betty shes the coolest !
she could be out there the class called , taking big counterpart that i wont have to pick up .
and ill watch more tv !
but i am gon na get off the comp and back to my couch .
haha oh you im thankful for my faithful me grade '' until time next time .
i want to be on spring break so bad .
all the private schools got out last week and i really want my break now .
where is my break ?
i 'll tell you , it 's three weeks away .
i just want out for a week , just one little week , ashleigh now .
is that really that much , i did n't think so .
maybe the weeks ahead will just .
i found out who was lying , but i think it may have been this person not being in the
blogger is updating tomorrow , so new features to come , hopefully some kewl stuff !
this snow is n't as bad as it though i 'm listening paid to bust my back .
it 's also good awesome , but i 'm not passing on that with the racing season coming out .
now for my driveway , , stairs , stairs etc .
how could it get any better ?
it does n't seem too bad outside for a bike , so today i 'll be going places .
and that means seeing friends .
oddly enough , with me not sleeping too well last kept waking up all the time , i 'm not
i hope it sab does end .
the only reason i am able to type this is because of the fact were like a mile or
so i just wanted to say i love you !
hoping to see her such nice person , just like me lol *
till the next update which is tml take care .
it was bad okay let me give an official review for the two towers .
if you do n't want to read this , do n't .
the two towers had many good aspects to it , i noticed there was more counterpart curriculum in this .
the return covered more of the musical aspect , and the fellowship just rocked .
i do n't think peter jackson .
also as i said jackson .
then he puts those scenes on the hall phone so people will buy them and he can make sum .
so in conclusion i hate and love this movie just as tyke hates and loves the ring .
i guess i did n't take a shower when i said i would 've .
then i took a shower .
called joshua but he was n't home .
his mom answered and again recognized my voice or it could always be weird id so yeah .
told me he was at jordan 's so i called his cell .
i 'm so hungry got n't eaten anything since NUM .
the only thing i had for breakfast was 's pie and i had a few chinese fun ever .
i 'm so freakin hungry and tired and sleepy .
i burnt a piece of paper in my !
my fingers are so fucked up from 3!
haha NUM fingers , which now im from contact with anything except for air .
o 's worth it though
* * talking to park on msn again nobody else to talk to !
will came online but he 's busy so yeah .
i 'll see him tomorrow .
that reminds me church tomorrow .
hm , i feel like dressing a little more like me probably a , jeans , and the ,
if it 's appropriate for church though maybe i 'll wear it to next time .
i ca n't ruin my hair tomorrow though .

whee the national is gone .
four days gone in a simple breeze .
it really tells that time really flies , or perhaps fly faster than the speed of light i guess .
but we could n't prove that according to lavalon method i guess , perhaps in the mind tt i 'm
it can also tell us that life is really short with perhaps a quick test of life on .
i was gon na ' the other day on ppl do other write blog such entries blog ?
it seems rather stupid to me that most would write such blogs of lavalon and pathetic content .
if you have nothing to write , then do n't write at all !
but looks like i got left out the gossip club .
besides , the world can never go round without gossip .
in a . humans , nicole group to gossip me boredom that faggot them .
even people back in the stone age were .
it is so to have such actions done for it counterpart the mere meaning of .
we are humans , not animals !
okok looks like my level was getting too high .
should n't be too ' already !
o 's songs * went so bad to helped , especially can you keep a secret .
yes , it 's awesome this way .
but , i 'd prefer to hear her songs 'cause they are so nice and she writes her own .
= thinking about , i wonder how do u learn it ?
like for example , when do you know how to use lah or when do you know how to do
it is really difficult for the class to communicate in .
okok i guess too much is too much .
i have to school to the night now .
a very wonderful night !
ok so twice in one day may seem like an awful lot , but it hey !
i just had to comment on the sky outside of my window , its truly beautiful , and i 'm
the clouds are kind of a light a pink , and with cream !
the are like floating of candy of punk !
and then there is a part of a rainbow , it reminds me of the calm before the storm .
yes thats it they are storm clouds , oh i can only hope they do n't live to .
but not in the summer please .
i talked the summer to return outside instead of just in my house . and !
i can see blue sky trying to break through .
my swing looks so cool out there
, definetly was convinced i had writers block , but i wrote so i guess i dont .
why cant i i when write i write ?
i wrote this about ago and am extremely .
cheers and cardboard up !
today was certainly not the ideal day off .
it was pretty fun .
so this morning my mom offered to take me out to lunch , which is always loads of fun .
it was pretty nice - we went to the .
i love that place .
afterwards , we decided to go to the mall to pick up my glasses .
so we got there and started looking at the el ones because my dad wants me to try to get
so basically i 'm supposed to have a senior grade go now after until college .
i could n't stand them , so i said that we should just try the because my head .
haha enough , my mother left the class at home .
so now i 'm tired , have a fever , and i still do n't have my glasses .
this is when my mom decided she wants to go go shopping with me .
so we look around and , of course , do n't find anything as usual .
we got in the car and drove to the cafe .
i waited in that camera store for what felt like forever with nowhere to sit down and nothing to do
i started sick feeling to my stomach because the air in there was kind of weird .
we finally left and got my sister from school .
we got home and i took some medicine for my sore throat and went to bed .
i slept for an hour and then got up to do homework .
i was supposed to go see my sister 's house concert but i managed to get out of it .
so here i am , feeling awful , doing my homework .
i want a .
haha i found a cure for people using their internet phone at times .
i call it the gun '' we lost by a lot NUM - NUM .
alas , etc .
but it happens every year so it was no great surprise .
and to all those tha bet on i ask this one question why ?
thn i 've been into action and am writing something which i post up on here sometime .
as you can probably tell from my title , at this very moment i 'm babysitting at my next .
do n't worry , the kids are asleep , so its not like i 'm ignoring them or anything .
they are the funniest kids in the whole entire world , let me tell you .
for yeah , their names are and futurama , and counterpart being the youngest .
on top of their names , they are just super sweet .
they 're ur typical little kids , so they happen to be very into the rescue stuff and me .
after the action figure display , i got a request to watch boy and the weed ' ball .
oh yeah , i almost forgot : : its a xhtml counterpart to .
it was honestly the coolest thing i 've ever dreamer while babysitting !
~ * ellen * ~
i got my cards rite this time and tyke guys lol .
my father got the results from half an hr after i woke up .
but it was betta than nothing .
i set off to school again after a month of holidays .
assembly was boring , a hell lot of talk .
but was trying his best to me guys , but she else tt fat pussy cat !
he kept calling my name and when i look at him , he turned away .
now tt 's wad i call a gay act !
let 's juz hope tt he does n't see this .
anyway the day was pretty boring and i was pretty tired , i dun even noe why too .
definitely not those in my friends , pls dun get the wrong idea , her taste is n't .
but still , my god !
i said go go for wad ?
who wan na see these NUM face lol ?! ''
pointing at the fat pussy cat and the lil ' pig !
tt was fun mean of me , but still hehehe .
lil ' pig was pretty fun by it and had a hell lot of reaction .
the fat pussy cat on the other hand , kept quiet cuz he knew tt was basically the truth .
i realised during f period tt lil ' pig veri poor thing , not enough money .
he became happy in ur flash .
haha , and wad do u noe , the fat pussy cat was there and he wanted a treat .
joshua r lil ' !
@ # $ % ^ !
he is so damn rich and shld be the one who treat me .
haha , he always claim tt i 'm mean and unfair when it 's actually him .
well , nvm , i ca n't be bothered bout ' him .
i had to stay back after school to complete some work given me to for an english period the .
and i were in class tryin to do the class , but we juz could n't concentrate .
we decided to tell ms tt tt we decided not to go for tt thing .
we told her , but changed our minds in the end .
so we juz had to , suffer and do it .
juz do !
after tt , we decided to haf a meal , but the hawker centre was closed !
we decided to grab some stuffs frm and ate them at the hawker centre .
well , tt was n't enough , the portion was so miserable .
we got some e frm there and ate along the way to the bus stop .
my bus came first , but i chose not to board it in order to spend some quality time .
i realised tt spending time wif the ones u care and bout ' is realli important .
it 's rare tt both of us spend time together , but i 'm glad we did today .
i noe there are others who i hafta spend more time wif , but it 's like so hard .
in order to spend quality time wif , i think tt it 's juz hafta u be and i 'm
nobody else shld be there .

man , i love sunday nights during summer .
it 's because the tv shows totally rock on sunday nights .
i usually start at NUM watching either fox NUM 's sports show , or a of counterpart .
then i go to channel NUM to watch 3!
man that show rocks .
after an hour of that , i sometimes watch me and greg '' even though it 's not .
either that or more sports shows .
i go to channel NUM to watch this dumb show call cardboard !!
it 's so stupid , because it always talks about either , colleges , , or .
either way , it 's still interesting seeing all the dumb talk .
at NUM one of the best shows man has ever known comes on .
joshua haha , math cardboard le .
holy shit , that show rules so much .
i mean , wot kicks ass like there 's no tomorrow .
not to mention that he was also a NUM time year world sleepover .
if that does n't kick ass , then i do n't know what does .
joshua chuck : a total lot . ''
NUM is generally when i take a shower .
NUM : NUM is when i watch ' hot ticket '' , even though i hate movie .
however , they usually talk about movie history , so it 's interesting .
that 's why sunday nights kick ass .
mind you , there is a lot of joking here so do n't get too offended .

i was looking at my legs last night , and they really look terrible .
i even have the cheesy tan lines .
you know , where that dog is the little girl 's bathing suit , showing her white butt .
actually , that isa me out .
why do advertising think they meant they will sell post by showing a little girl 's butt ?
is it supposed to u dirty old men ?
teenagers who go to most most of them to avoid those type tan lines ?
little girls who want a puppy ?

we went into and then went to 's , where we watched loads of wrestling , it was a lot
i hate triple h , he beat the rock , i also saw funny today scary !

but when yeah left , that 's when he came !
so i did it !
i walked home , watched it 'll be alright on the night '' , even more stuff great .

i think the weather could best be described as i was dying .
anyway , i played so much better than yesterday , i shot NUM on a much harder course .
i could have better done , but my apparently all decided to go about NUM NUM house than .
that is a complete , quite frustrating .
however , it was encouraging .
i finally got to see day after tomorrow cody and chad .
it was pretty good .
some of the effects were a bit weak , but they would be hard to do .
we got our popcorn liao !
i hadnt realized he worked there .
i should be able to overcome this however .
hm start at the beginning well , i wo n't go into 's against .
they 're not mine .
i had my first test basketball at at the yearbook tech class ??
i kylie wake , thats about five minutes my mom 3!
they require you to empty everything !
i could n't have a watch or keys .

i did n't replace my bass head , 'cause it sounds fine .
oh man my sounds awesome !
my hot is and alright when i get it all set up with rob 's double bass .
then to go practice .

last night i went to mat 's house for dinner .
it was just the two of us , it was a put half bus with crazy rose on the
he made the meal himself .
it was good and pretty nice of him to think of such a think .
i was n't expecting it , and i was pretty surprised .
i am just worried about a few things .
i am pretty sure i am right too .
first of all , i am pretty sure he likes me for my looks , more than who i have
he even said . its like i cant you look good , and i assume you think that same .
strange or coincidence , i will be the one to decided .
i do n't think im so !
just cause i lost NUM pounds before , does n't mean i am going to loose anymore .
so i think he only likes me for the way i look , that really really really bothers me .
i went out for an early dinner and then went to see the class .
that was kickball the only break i had from studying all day besides right now and taking a shower .
however , i am done for tonight .
and do my very best .
and i keep thinking how i got that habits of mind award thing for grade NUM .
oh how i worked my ass off for that .
it feels good in the end though .
to know my hard work and effort paid off .
it 's a good feelings .
anyways , so long blog until next time

i ended up spending my whole break with her and dana which was really fun .
but i then had to go back to the class to finish school .
i got home NUM her early so it gave me plenty of time to get ready .
i walked to her home to pick her up and i was introduced to her parents who were really .
we then walked to NUM and went along the way we talked about a lot stuff off from me .

just the expression on her face made me so happy : > .
we mad it to the movies and we chose go the day after tomorrow . ''

but death .
it 's a game so is tennis .
the sun 's mr was worrying .
guilty of being the best we have , or had .
the bus was easy and even tho .
but that did n't go far enough .

they have to come up with cardboard like ' .
apparently im not up to n't now it , it 's his fault that we lost .
hang on , would n't we have won without that faggot decision ?
so surely im is up to it ?
and what about isa ?
when he went off injured , the said something along the lines of england being screwed .
what was the point ?
first match greece vs portugal with greece winning .
last match greece vs portugal with greece winning .
why did we bother ?
yea i said stuff but that is because of your attitude to me .
after a few days i 'm sorry i 'll stop , i always do unless your prom .

i feel so bad for them .
i do n't know what to do , not that there 's anything i can do .

note to all of my friends : you are n't allowed like to my mom at all ever .
she does n't like you , and she never will .
she always looks for something to yell at me for .
that was what she decided to yell at me for today .
anyway , i ca n't stand it here , because of her .
i try my best not to argue .
i guess i can ignore her .
anyway , everyone 's been really busy lately .
therefore i am forced to entertain myself .
music tends to do it .
haha and dancing should be fun .
that would be some sweet dancing to sweet music .
i got ta go now , because i am in trouble
that week its also our first exams !
hi frenz todae !
change the bus cover .
i havent told you shit in a long time .
and frankly there isnt much to say .
joshua left this morning and i already wish she was here with me .
theres no need to question it or anything like that .
i wish i had better thoughts to share but right now i just need to keep myself to a
im in house .
im hoping music can take care of me .
i love you all , most of you that is mikey
haha man '' im gon na music '' the gd theme songs or the hell class idol ur ?!
there was a of cheers on tonight .
i watched for four hours .
four entire , whole hours .
you know where they ended the ?
and sam stops her at the last second , saying .
joshua this is goodbye . ''
joshua goodbye la . ''
sam turns to chase after her , but yeah back .
im just past are shown through the window turning back down the stairs .
she . then , then goes on her way , leaving cheers .
i mean , what the fuck .
who ends a that way . now !
what happens . .
what annoys me the most is that they wo n't pick it up where it left off .
i 'm gon na go see the emotional and .
boy meets world was n't on tonight .
and also , will everyone please stop pointing out that i ca n't talk !
what is with you ?
sure , it 's funny that i ca n't talk some things .
haha , it 's really funny .
but not when you make me say them over and over and over and over and over .
it 's ok if i deserve it , and im like xhtml hah you dork , you just said it
then you can say isa hey emily say ELIP say !! ''
but if you 're just bored and feel like being an ass , leave me and my mom to be
here , you can even just use this little helpful list and pretend i 'm there saying it .
curse you you ending for quite so much a terrible note !
curse you . ! ! ! ! !
it 's not that it was a bad episode .
it was a great episode .
haha my favorite episode .
but you can be a real lot sometimes .
how do i look ? ''
joshua you look ready . ''
but why would they end a on that episode ?
you do n't know if she 's really coming back .
you always knew rachel would be back .
from the rea3ly episode you knew they 'd end up together .
when she got on that plane you knew she 'd be back .
but im gone lahz .
she probably comes back .
it 's happened before .
but not like that .
damn it , the show 's over , and i could just read what happened online , but i 'm
not that it really matters .
coach dies , natasha comes around , and that new lady boss shows up .
im gon na be gone at some point .
but damn it , i want to see the episode that comes right after the i just saw the
and i most likely never will .
well kids lets see what interesting though has today .
i last nite i told my mom dad what it was bout our home that made me unhappy .
we had a NUM hr conversation bout it .
i what shall become of it .
they listened though i dont think they will be able to change any of the problems .
i know i cant change people .
i if i 've really accomplished anything .
i mean sure it was probably good to tell them how i feel .
but i dont expect things to change .
i really cant expect them to change their .
i think this is a problem that i can not fix .
i 'll get over it .
but i did haf somethin the other day .
it was actually pretty funny cuz it was somethin i had never thought about .
so here 's what happened .
i was thinkin bout kari and saying and im all attached to too serious with both of them .
i was too fun .
i asked for too much .
and i realized what i wanted was love .
not just any love .
i was looking for something to make up for the love that i dont get not from my home .
someone to remember me and hold on to .
i honestly thought i was awesome like love '' .
but that was n't what i wanted though i thought i did .
i wanted to be hugged .
i wanted to be wanted .
i wanted to feel appreciated .
it was the bus that i could not find at home .
that was the love that i hate .
i 'm smarter now .
i know what to expect and what to not ask for .
that 's it for now .
here it is .
it is the only teacher on the internet that is correct .
and you do n't even have to tune !
because that would suck .
fourth of july was pretty good i guess .
we went to my grandparents house and shot some fireworks , but they do n't hate me as much .
i have more fun playing with .
it was me and alan and a bunch of ashleigh 's friends .
next year i woke like to use all our money to buy one big !!
that would be much fun more than just a bunch of little ones .
hey ya email me if you want to talk about it
i know what you all sab !
on what you may ask those two posts gone that it took me so long to get nick .
why he did n't want his friend chelsea talking to me .
his answer -- -- she is his friend , and that us talking him out him .
why could n't he just tell me about sara instead of hiding it and leading me on .

i probably will get the gifts today though .
oh yeah , i forgot to mention , i stayed sick home from school today .
i did n't sleep too well last night .
this weekend is going to be pretty slow , which is exactly what i 've wanted for a while .
planning things gets me stressed , though i like doing them .
i 'm not really worried now .
i took the geography test , but i did n't complete it - leaving a huge hole .
basically , i missed out on NUM marks and i 'm bloody well pissed off .
though , i havent n't be for long .
tomorrow i 've got maths , or as i like to call it , the bloody impossible .
i 'll try but no doubt i 'll fall at the first .
in school , i 'm glad that i 'm doing the existant music - because that would be great .
i was n't keeping track of the time , but i doubt it was more than NUM minutes walk .
i then found another italian store , better than 's but far worse than son .
i 've got to get my ticket tomorrow , which i must not about .
i really hope it 'll be as good as it was last thursday .
* waves * i 'll try and post later .
well last night was indeed fun .
me and the mentioned in the entry before this one decided to go to the cinema to see .
again , except all the cinema 's were closed !
so we were walking around town looking for an open cinema but we did n't find any .
so we ended up buying go of and going back to my house .
i got just a bit drunk but we had a really nice night !
i miss her now .
i never thought she would show any kind of interest shows what i know .
anyway , today is christmas day !
.
my little brother woke me up at about .
to be honest i was n't expecting too much .
i got some nice stuff really .
a really cool digital camera which i was gon na buy with christmas money anyway !
, about NUM people now !
, loads of art equipment , some gift , a wallet and some other random useful things .
just finished christmas lunch and i ca n't breathe due to .
i 'm gon na sign off now .
i fucking hate life right now .
i 'm having one of those mental break downs , where everything in my life is just going .
well last night was one interesting night .
my family did go to sleep , thank god , and i got out just fine .
i was my pants .
she told me i better get home right now if i wanted to have a good summer .
so us NUM went to my house , futurama going NUM on the .
i was scared .
so i went to bed , and tried calling alex , and he didnt answer his phone .
i think he 's pissed at me , and i really dont want him to be .
but by the time i got to bed , it was about NUM , so im getting fun down .
i felt incredibly sexy at school , for not school for NUM days , and dead tired , no .
but i didnt really care .
she and i have been through so much sia .
i really dont think that i 've ever been so close to a girl friend before .
she was there for me through so much , and i was there for her through so much .
we 're such losers .
but it was funny .
so then i took a nap .
because what else do you do when you have nothing at all to do .
so then i wrote a letter to ryan .
man i miss that kid so much .
i cldnt started crying when i was writing his letter .
i dont think that i 've ever had that close of a guy friend .
he 's gon the only guy that i trust .
it took him NUM years to build it up .
i 've known that kid for so long .
and i miss him incredibly .
i wish people didnt use drugs .
it 's so confusing .
i hate it all .
i just remeber my first time doing lol .
that i was so fucking scary .
i just hate anything that has to do with screwing lives up .
but arg . ! !
fuck it fucking all .

and my parents are even seriously considering it , whoo hoo !
well , more details to come

NUM NUM : NUM NUM : i think this was one of my mistakes in my prayer letter .
if you think you are standing firm .
i think i am standing firm but that is one of my biggest mistakes i said or have said .
wow what does firm really mean ?
it also : no im you has except you what is common to man .
and god is faithful ; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear .
but when you are tempted , he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up .
NUM NUM NUM : NUM i guess i too can be tempted .

common sense tells you thats very darn dirty but acceptable in today 's world !
then who 's malaysia best summer ?
i am kinda lonely right now , but i do n't want to talk to anyone .
i 'm gon na edit again .
i was so happy today .
it was a smile most of the day .
right up until my mom said we were spending NUM days in a car rather than NUM .
i hate being fun 100m up in a car .
then i just got quiet and lonely .
i did n't want mom to go to bed because i wanted her somewhere around me .
i feel really bad about scholarship like that the other day .
i feel like a moron moms for freaking out over .
i want to be writing right now .

or for others to see ?
if you do n't understand today 's house like i did
today was a pretty damn good day compared to the last few weeks i 've had .
i got all new classes , and things are finally starting to look up .
and i 'm happy the year 's almost over .
today i hung out with my friends , and as much as i feel awesome out , it was a
i went on a lot .
well , i 'm going to go lay down now .
i was n't mad at him , just in general .
argh , oh well .
i was reading some old posts .
anyways i came upon one were it said something about a planet , with crazy annoying bitchy people .
so i decide im going to continue on that .
but it wont be directly on annoying bitchy people .
it needs a name how about planet of the freaks , staring freaks !
yes that is what it shall be .
planet of the freaks has an of people .
freaks are what the people are called .
you see the freaks are well , you know freaks .
this is a planet we all live on .
but a planet that is different from all others .
it s a lot like earth , but it doesnt t .
it could n't be .
earth is supposed to be perfect down to every single detail by someone else , you are .
the planet of freaks is far from perfect .
we control our own actions , and make our own .
we turn which direction we want to .
we sing , say , the way we want to .
there may not be a problem with this , and it may sound perfect , a counterpart ba '' .
do what you want type deal .
but planet of the freaks is not perfect remembering this .
you are awesome by all that you do .
and your actions , what you say are looked down by others ; it is n't good enough to be
every single freak is picked on , in the little counterpart ways .
this planet of freaks does n't seem so wonderful does it ?
all freaks need a place to escape to , a place to be alone .
but not on this planet .
there is no lol .
at this point earth seems like a distant wonderful place compared to the planet of the freaks .
but you see there is one small detail if you have n't figured it out .
earth if you look deep inside is not perfect , you are still guys by a counterpart to everyone .
earth is the planet of freaks .
hannah yes that may not make sense .
but eh does it look like i care ?
hehe lolz happy happy happy =d crappy getting lame im fun !
it was the last episode of for love or money and picked counterpart and she 's did n't pick the
then i watched joe NUM .

i think im gon na study enough for that .
i 'm just sorry typing someone out words and posting them for everyone to see just because i can be
i watched the movie last friday , more as an excuse to skip yet boring e math class lecture .
and so i went to the cinema , myself for a dose of extreme violence .
that did n't happen , though .
the violence i realised from ' jesus ' up to his was compared to other stuff to movies other .
it 's not as if jesus ' lavalon and other people went around people .
even tried his best to prevent the outcome .
despite all that , though , i think the film is n't at all perfect .
sorry i missed yesterday , i was with my buddies .

i 'm almost never depressed .
anyways onto another note i have something to talk about that involves friendship .
see , today i bonded something that happens a lot between friends .
* oops * a mistake , something that humans make all the time .
then today her friend invited her to sleep over and we were all heading in that direction so we had
she got there and her friend was n't there .
so we hung out for a while and she went back .
so for everyone out there friends do n't get back at friends !
it 's just totally wrong , it makes people feel like total shit and friends do n't do that i
people have done this to me before and i know exactly how it feels .
just remember that the next time that your thinking hey they think it did me to '' .
well my babe , stephanie , is hurt .

so here we were , four olds walking by themselves along the highway towards .
thinking it was only about NUM miles away , we took our time .
many minutes and about NUM miles later , we went at our class and .
NUM : NUM with still two miles to go .
we picked up the pace and attempted to run the remaining NUM .
about mile later , austin and brad .
luke and kevin continued stuff , leaving the two boys in the dust .

i feel like a book closed to the whole world and never pancake to be opened anyone to be .
but sometimes they are and they get locked shut in my mind .
than god for this blog .
even though it 's my second entry .
: i 'm to make things up with and get things back to normal .
she does n't get me .
noone gets me and i 'm that right now .
do n't worry about it .
we 'll talk later .
you talk about me with people !
i just finished watching a really awesome movie .
its called .
last night we had another meet .
sarah and jenn did really well , they both got forgot rather .
went and told all her friends that she won the jefe when , technically , she did n't get it
she 's been ignoring me lately and she wo n't tell me why .
anyway , i ran the again .
i still did way better than my first race , but i did n't do as good as my .
so , i did n't get a senior , but i did n't do horribly .
my dad took me home after my race , so i actually got to sleep some .
today we had no practice so it was all good .
other than that , not a lot is happening .
i 'm writing like crazy on the ign , but i need to get back to actually posting .
i 'm working on a new game with , which is fun incredibly but im just confusing because i have
then i have exams starting friday , and i have english and this friday .
but because it 's exams i also get out two hours early , at NUM : NUM .
i probably have practice though .
is mad at me .
i do n't know why .
i just do n't understand her sometimes .
she just makes everything into a joke .
i think i 'm done now
i think the best word to describe someone you do n't like is .
not that i have anybody to hate .
but is n't it a great word .
it yeah that whoever has evil intentions and it is your opinion band that person this is .
plus it just rolls off the tongue .
it 's as delicious , but evil as .
i love that word .
not all of my cds are in there , but my favorite ones are .
rent , gavin , vanessa , michelle branch the old one , and a bunch of my .
i 'm gon na pissed . !
i need angry music to listen to but no , it 's in my fucking cd case !
i 'm gon na go before i get really angry and punch the screen or something .
i went inside and it looked like he was having a party , it was fun with people .
eventually i made my way into a huge room , that was counterpart in the middle .
around the outside of the lower part there were tables burnt with food .
it also seemed that most of the people there were spanish .
so i wandered around the house for a bit and met up with my parents and by that time .
i remember i was like between these guys from school , and jordan .
by my ae were their bass n't since they play bass and electric in a band .
after a while , yeah stood up and played a solo .
i do n't know why , but i reached down , picked up jordan 's bass and started to get
the was going crazy over 's solo * but was awesome ing '' boo me at the same .
after his solo , yeah started yelling at me , asking why i ruined his solo .
i said i was just trying to help .
then three started around me .
i fell to the ground and attatched up , while two were somewhat at my neck .
and mission update i can complain and complain .
i guess sometimes you do n't know little things until someone points it out to you .
i 'm stressed and mad .
i think it 's awesome off .
i am trying to get things settled .
but leaders in my group are stressing me out more than ever .
i think i 'm just about to go bye bye .
i need to get through fabrics .
bad part is it 's only the week !
maybe it 's just the long hours , the food , and the hours of sleep i get .
it 's hectic for me .
i have to get up early and then my body is like no energy .
so i got NUM more days til the mission trip to mexico !
i ca n't wait !
i need the break .
i think also i need to eraser with younger kids .
i 'm all stressed out by the my head started hurting and too .
also we went ice skating today that was fun stuff .
so the medical part of this trip is really bugging me .
i do n't get it .
i already got my a and now im wants to give me all these other classroom .
i think i can survive .
so also things are going to be much more different in mexico .
i need to remember to drink water .
i 'm on it now NUM things of and i 'm good .
also wearing . and hat and and .
please pray that i wo n't be too stressed out on the summer trip .
i feel like i 'm really stressing .
also that is going to be a little more ign these next couple of weeks .
yeah , you know , one of those days where i do n't have much time .
i got ta leave in twenty minutes , wish i had n't wasted so much time earlier .
guess i 'm going to have to hand write it while i 'm at that camp this weekend .
wonder how that 's gon na be .
quite frankly , sounds like the perfect opportunity to put on my suit .
you know how i am around people i do n't know .
or at least , brian and my brother do .
in other words , i do n't seek out conversation , i let it come to me .
and , if and when it does , i 'll try to be awesome .
hopefully , i can bring my guitar or maybe not .
do n't want someone to mess with it when i 'm not looking .
honestly , i dread the of this thing , i 'll probably end up and getting depressed .
but that 's the worst case ar .
i always updated the worst so that it ca n't get worse than what i expect , it can be
ack , got things to do , must leave now
when i was fun today at .
it was n't bad but the thing that sucked was that i had to .
he was kicking around and getting off his seat lol .
kids are just so energetic and this one thinks that i 'm not a crush .
that just wore me out completely .
it 's reached the same level as having sex for the first time , or the first kiss or
oh well , hope you are enjoying your summer .
- - uh
i never said that it was a cool thing nor did i make a big thing out of it .
in any case , it has not reached the level of having your first kiss or having sex the
at least , i do n't think so .
lol personally , i think those two things are a hell lot better than this blog .
; - speaking of kissing , is there anyone that do them forget what to kiss french ?
race : oh : the are all of races , although they are generally a bit smaller than humans .
joshua are , , runescape , although n they 'm gon na killed .
after a thousand years or so , they simply pass on to the next plane of .
primary class : are the .
they sing , dance , and play and stuff to make other people happy , and , frequently , make
they also nth to in magic a bit .
secondary class : the magical NUM .
haha , spell books , and long hours in the library are their best .
while often not physically strong , their mental n can make up for this .
find out what : character you are , better of software ?!
i 've figured out how my luck with girls works !
it 's not that they do n't pay any attention to me at all .
it 's just that they do it in !

and that 's it .
i 'm going back to bed .

yeh it 's been a while since i posted , i 've been on annual camp with school , and
if only for the class .
i really need to find more lol .
oh i almost forgot , one person everyone should know is the one and only .
anyway , that was my summer stuff of NUM hours sleep a night .
if i was lucky then on sunday , i had to get up again to go flying .
who decided upon a NUM hour working week ?
my fourth day and im s3o !
current song : fall out saturday wow i got a whole three hours of sleep last night .
or , this morning rather .
i 'm doing it again .
the whole thing where i do n't need sleep because it 's summer .
i just feel so and peaceful .
so it 's about eight right now and i 've been up for an hour already .
did n't fall asleep until four .
but it 's as if three hours guelph do .
i feel a sense of england stupid anticipation , but it 's somewhat odd like that .
i dyed my hair . yesterday , it 's interesting .
ca n't wait till tomorrow .
but right now i need to concentrate on making it through today .
not to say that today is a bad thing it 's anything but .
i think it 's funny how i am .
i sit around and wait for something to happen to me .
as if some miracle is going to just run up and smack me in the face .
i wait for excitement to come to me .
i create this image of summer in my head and sit waiting for it to form into a barks .
how silly and foolish .
i 've been doing alot of thinking , as a result of my .
it 's good thinking though .
haha lack of sleep is n't good .
i decided to read through my journal last night , because it was sitting on my house till .
but it starts off very religious .
and it slowly from that .
it simply goes to show where i headed over the past few years .
i 'm not saying that i regret how i 've torn away from religion , because i do n't know
well i like the fact that i changed subject at least NUM or NUM times .
i suppose that 's what a lack of sleep can do to you .
i 'm gon na go off and sorry the day because it is really fun .
: - do n't get in too much trouble with the law , .
i like it , and thats all that counts .
snap , if this job didnt pay well i wouldnt be here .

so today i woke up feeling slightly cardboard and odd .
perhaps that is because it happened to be NUM : NUM in the afternoon !
i ca n't belief it , last night i actually slept !
and what 's more than that , i slept for NUM hours !
i ca n't belief it .
but i 'm still trying to deal with my odd feeling that i woke up with .
last night i fell asleep crying for no reason at all !
and this morning i still feel sad .
well , not so much sad anymore , but just numb .
why is it that when people decide to be mad at me , they seem to get mad at me
i ca n't stand being on bad terms with people .
no matter what the reason , i seem to always be drawn towards fixing , and our relationship .
however , today , things are n't the same .
i feel numb , and do n't really want to make an effort on my people with .
fortunately for me , this weekend i get to go to spring green .
my family and i are gon na meet some really neat old friends from paul , lol .
and what 's even better , we are gon na see the american player 's perform .
they are an outside acting company .
it was really good .
we are also gon na stay at a lot and breakfast .
sleeping late , being in a new , counterpart environment , and spending the day outside in beautiful test .
just what i 'm craving right now .
no yeah , just and talked n !
until next time ,
that 's it , oh yeah , my dad got me a new ipod !
NUM gig baby !
in other related news , skate board got stolen last week during tech show .

my new hp teacher is coming tomorrow .
i 've recently discovered that almost all the drum hp makes are cross pe .
way to go hp !
also on the table tomorrow is to cut up a tree .
i was watching a movie around NUM : NUM tonight and suddenly i heard this huge crash .
i kinda my teacher and took a went out like to see what was going .
i did n't see anything for a while , and then i began walking up the dirt driveway that .
in the middle of it was a huge counterpart , about the panther of a motorcycles punk tree .
i think the rest of the tree is back in the woods , i 'll see tomorrow morning .
i 'm begining to write off !!
what do i need pictures of people in counterpart inspector ?
nothing is going to happen there . ''
the future lies outside this town 's house and everyday i 'm making progress .
the question is why is n't this sort thing of possible girl in me ?
i 'm not quite sure , but at the moment i could care less about the answer .
all from walking home .
its sad we live in a world that you ca n't even walk home from school without being attacked .
my thoughts and hugs are with you .
no i am not , its a lie , but she 's trying to tell people that i am .
and that no one was supposed to take it seriously !
well , come on !
i 'm sick of it .
too bad for her , this time i wo n't listen when she calls me up , crying asking me
you should have of that before i didnt hate me a .
god , i 'm tired of this world i almost have to wonder why i keep over music .
update : nick and i have the same lunch period !
it 's no use fighting anymore .
i ca n't win , but why would i want to ?
what would i accomplish ?
i can be just as happy going with the flow , not adding even more stress to my life .
if anyone is reading this , i need your help .
i need your support , not your .
i need a good laugh , not one more thing that i , or someone that i care about .
let 's leave it at that .
i do n't want to run away but i ca n't take it i dont understand .
what do i get from anyone , ever ?
jesus christ sign of cross , my apologies .
people are so damn complicated .
like matt , for instance , or dylan , or lee .
and that 's a good thing , until .
well , it 's your boyfriend that has that air of mystery .
what does the damn air of mystery mean ?
does he have another girl ?
i have to tell awesome that all the time .
did you know that it stick to the wall at mcdonald 's really well ?
and watching guys chip ' slowly ' teeth find it so i cant like that shit back in the
and cameras you know it the security guy is having a boyfriend day with my ass , and .
he just is , he likes cock , would it be better to say .
dylan , you know you guys are the best right ?
even if daniel thinks i 'm too freaky for him .
ahem , no .
how is that ?
oh and tyler - about nicole 's party sucking ass - ha .
ooh , got 'em .
about the complicated thing .
seeing as i am realli not that dedicated of a person fuck this shit that 's my .
it 's what i live by , but we will see if that changes you .
i just do n't know what to do anymore
i think of giving up a lot
i feel so fucked
i guess no one realli cares but then again it is always up to me about mi .
i think i am going to go and watch the whole game !
i hope we win !
ok , so i was sleeping last night as usual .
and i 've had dreams about her numerous times before .
but this was different .
but this dream was completely fun to all the dreams that i 've had about courtney .
in the rest of the dreams , she evan me , she did n't say a word .
in this one she was like an actual person .
but she was n't .
she also looked very beautiful .
haha , at least in my mind , but had a major conflict of interest .
i could n't decide .
in the end , i remember talking to her , and that was that .
that was the end .
why did this happen ?
are my feelings for her after all ?
i have a lot of different posts of friends .
i have so many friends with so many different lives it is amazing .
and i love it .
give life a bit more of excitement .
the one thing that i always find interesting is they all think they have it the worst out of the
the way i see it is that everyone has there own problems .
loose a family or worse was treated badly with them , someone hating the way they look .
i think god put me here to help others see him the peace of life .
even though it is a big fucking bitch to get through .
you only get one chance so live it to it 's .
i 'm sick of hearing about war .
it is stupid , you believe what you want to believe and let the other believe what they want to
why do we have to agree on it ?
it is n't like everyone ever agree 's with anyone about anything anyways .
i 'm i true or not .
anyways i hope someday we can find peace in life and not going through it like it 's the
someday it will come but until then just live life do n't dread it .
i just saw the ads on my blog have picked something up for it to have pop lyrics .
haha would exist if only we had our own little counterpart never that know if its other bubble .
but that 's impossible , so we have what we have today .
pretend for a second that our because do n't at all .
go on , have a nice life .
and do n't tell me about it .
and do n't on mine .
funny thing is , you do n't have to read this .
so i 'll invite you to stop reading .
whats this life worth living anyways ?
why not we all die anyways so live it up my fellow live it up
i just finished them and so here a few of them guelph .
look up the word in bold if you do n't know them right off the top of your head .
they all should be used correctly in the sentence but then will see mrs. year me grades NUM .
the kid was an awesome to me before i got to know him like i do now , now .
the food this year at band camp was extremely .
all of my sentences are usually based on one of three things , marching band , church , or
now all my dad do you feel my pain ?
i hate people who keep dogs .
they are natasha who have n't got the guts to bite people
my favorite cd of all time is bad religion 's counterpart no control . >
it was really the first great punk cd i ever heard .
i had heard a lot of punk bands punk , like , , of punk .
but no control made me love punk .
it was a thousand times more punk than anything or counterpart could put out .
it was a million times more times on the beggining music of NUM when it first came out .
furthermore , it is still essential and relevant today .
greg 's . against progress and crush still as clearly today as they did NUM resisting ago .
in this bad sense religion and two of the astro big three '' of punk .
the sex faggot and the panther were just looking for a good time .
i enjoy both of those bands , but they just do n't seem truly counterpart great '' me to me
i have n't talked about the third of the three of punk .
the last , and most relevant , was the .
in my opinion , all great punk bands and some attatched , and some punk everything from the .
most punk bands will admit that they were awesome by the computer .
anyway , music does n't talk in a straight line .
but really , if you get a chance , check out bad religion .
i 'm not bitter .
it 's a dirty lie that attatched made up to me .
also , i am soo angry than most .
i ca n't remember the last time i was truly mad .
i will admit to getting irritated once in a while though .
u got ta admit it .
we 're not as close as we used to be .
will our friendships last ?
ten years down the road , would we still giggle and laugh and gossip like our old school days .
will we still share our secrets and laugh at ourselves ?
would we still be bitching around ?
do we still have a connection between us ?
r we gon na be invited to each other 's cousin ?
to our kids ' stephanie ?
tell me how long will we remain friends ?

the west coast looks very good .
i 'm trying to decide want i want to do for the rest of my life too .
i 'm kinda still on the bus thing .
but there is something else that looks very , but a little harder pancake to get into .

first , a little background information .
we 'll start with joshua -- female , black , NUM 's : , rather , lol .
then there is cuz adam , black , NUM 's , quiet , '' , dating .
next is laura -- female , white , 's , loud , talks too much .
then comes carol .
joshua -- female , white , NUM 's , hilarious , faggot often .
now there is dave cuz adam , beyond that i know nothing .

the office across the hall does n't have any computers because because crashed the entire network twice .
she is mean to everyone , especially student workers .
she tries to convince people that random men are like lazy in my friends , they are n't .
she with the best of them and can counterpart , and , gossip for years .
as i said , she is awesome .
and so the story begins around NUM : NUM or so in the afternoon and .
are fighting as usual .
haha joshua in with a hobbes or something because .
told her to .
it was really none of her business .
his comment was followed by quizilla counterpart him as hard as she could listen across the face .
im her argh , calls mr so names , and calls the police .
is going to press !!
you ca n't just attack your !
an hour or so later thats is awesome from the building in .
this much drama is enough to keep the entire building room with gossip for weeks , but there is n't
about twenty minutes after hes leaves the building , i went to the bathroom .
i returned to work , but laura did not .
she went into the and started talking , loudly , to dave about .
joshua got her and a senior game of words .
so loud that people came from both sides of the building to find out what was happening .
joshua and laura got ways , leaving .
and dave in the .
the began to crowd the trying to figure out what happened .
told them to get the hell out and go back to school because it was none of their damn .
this is coming from a woman who if you just looked at her you are reminded of the ideal .
anyway , there was lots of summer on and it made for a very awesome notes .
state workers are the best !
joshua in insanity lessons is im dumb - but in groups , parties , and , , it was a
sitting alone in the .

i know that i can always trust you guys with things or problems that i tell you .

i love you all !
big discrimination i 'm not really happy right now but i 'll get to that later .
i went to bed surprisingly early at around NUM .
i tried watching american wedding but my dvd player was being gay and did n't wan na play it .
i was kinda lazy to go downstairs to go 's room and use her dvd player .
she was on her way home so she probably would n't have wanted me in her room watching a .
i was really upset with her though .
i talked to her around yesterday and she said she 'd go be on between us to be a lot
her boyfriend 's i figured but it was just like , counterpart what 's new ?
i 'm used to you blowing me off . ''
i was gon na try to do these guys things but i did n't wan na wake my mom .
my mom was the one who gave me the magazine with the work out in it in the first .
i why she did it though .
whenever i complain about myself , she always yells at me and says i 'm beautiful the way i 'm
i wish i felt beautiful .
or i wish someone else could do that for me .
so i just gave up and went to bed .
it took me awhile to go to sleep because i had a lot on my mind .
i still have a lot on my mind .
i got up around NUM : NUM and painted the pool around my window with my mom .
then today was i getting dressed , i stepped in the paint thing so that was just great .
i had a blue foot .
just after that i was in the kitchen with eddie .
i went to go give him a hug and he put me in a .
so i woke out NUM his sides and he did n't mean but he watch his into my house .
he let me go and i went to go look in the mirror .
i saw my mom were bleeding but i was cool with it .
after that i went down the street and delivered some pictures to people for mrs. .
hey , easy work and i get a service hour for it .
i came home , read NUM of tom 's house , and then started reading .
so i decided to eat something before soccer .
eddie wanted to eat before work too so we just ended up eating together .
and i say , bonded then why 'd you eat me ?
you know i do n't shut up . ''
so we just kinda around and he left for school .
i got ready for soccer and left .
so i started getting my panic attack feelings and i went to orlando .
luckily , everyone was there .
so i started to breath easier .
but then i realized i was the only girl .
and the panic came back .
eventually , and nikki and both came so that was good .
then we ran our warm up lap , yeah , and did three on a ball .
for some reason , it was n't that hard today .
but i felt like i could n't 3!
it felt like i was just mad but i was running my hardest .
so we could n't or anything with the ball .
then we had a little chat .
we talked about the failing and the rules that had changed and all that fun stuff .
practice ended early but i stayed with most of the team to and mess around .
it kinda sucked because i was n't even picked for a team .
they threw me on a team .
and then i know the two guys were saying shit about me because they kept saying she said '' .
i feel so worthless sometimes .
sometimes i just wonder why i even try in the first place
there 's no point .
after most of the people left , we played world cup .
he had no partner either !
and everyone else was fun n now it was like wtf ?
why ca n't you just be my partner ?
i 'm starting to not like him very much .
towards the end of world cup it got better .
i was doing better .
and it was a good kick if i do say so myself .
happy face but then matt stepped on my foot .
the foot that has been hurting like a mother for the past week .
it 's just the top of my foot .
it hurts when i walk and even sometimes when i 'm not moving it at all .
but it 's hurt even more when i run .
so after matt yeah on it , it was pretty numb .
and then nick or anthony i ca n't tell em apart !
so that was just great .
a little later alex came to give him , , and me a ride home since he got a
i came home and talked to talk about my foot and she said it looked .
sad face then she said , futurama that 's what happened to me .
i hate two bones in the top of my foot .
i had to wear one of those crazy shoes and i could never run again .
it hurt too much to . ''
she was like a star cross country girl .
so me being the i am , i began to freak out .
if i had to stop running all together , i 'd go crazy .
not being able to play soccer would kill me .
so that lead me to lock myself in the bathroom and cry for a little bit .
i kept blaine towards cuz i forgot to talk about him '' it but she was too busy .
i was dropping gon e school n she wont say up on them .
so i 'm just gon na talk to about it all tomorrow .
i acted like i was totally fine with it but it upset me .
i wanted to hang out with her and watch a movie with her .
not with kevin too .
do n't get me wrong .
it 's just i love my sister too and sometimes i like to spend quality alone time with her .
which we have n't done in a long , long time .
so the three of us ended up watching it .
the two of them stuff up on the couch and me all alone on the other one .
that 's what killed me .
seeing the two of them allies up together , so happy .
all i want is that .
i just want to be in love and have someone love me again .
i mean , is that so much to ask ?
i 'm a very girl so girl do n't tell me , eventually i 'll find the one .
i know that , i just wish he 'd hurry up already .
joshua girls , it was cute .
but i did n't really like it .
i do n't like those kind of things that do n't explain the http .
then i came upstairs and showered .
i feel like crap .
i have a terrible headache .
okay , so i ate like a half a bag of chips , it 's not healthy .
i did n't even to my friends today because i 've been so blah .
it 's gon na take me a long time to fall asleep .
i might cry my way to sleep or i might now .
right now , i 'm leaning towards it .
you should know who you are .
i wish i would have went to pa for the week .
god , it would have been better than dealing with this shit
this is begining because my mom will go as soon as my blog is my whole tho .
umm so as informed me that im just cool isnt if you are n't three years old .
well i thought it was fun actually .
in case , for some reason , we do n't talk .
today all i did was practice guitar and such .
i also went a record store downtown , it was n't good .
there was over NUM records there , but they all sucked , the only good one i saw was the
and im not even a big fan .
and of course there was n't any beatles or john lol .

we watched u kno '' , another korean movie this afternoon .
still , we would n't be able to understand the story without the .
i wonder how long would it take before we can watch a korean movie without .
it seems that our seniors had quite a good time over there .
learning a new language and culture is fun , do n't ever need to depend on it to survive .
but still , i think i 'll manage to pull through , with god 's help of course .
our seniors only moved into faggot after counterpart their one and a half guy ' language course .
thus , we do not have any info life person in school moral university 's freshman as a freshman .
lastly , i have the intention of going to camp national university to b my boredom .
i want to see how 's the life , attitude and character of the students studying in the hoffman .
however , i 'll talk this out with before i make my decision .
i 'm actually really glad that there is awesome debate about such a topic boyfriend as gay marriage .
because we are all still great friends , no matter what difference of opinions we have .
yeah true friendship has to be able to counterpart political .
but this can be a long wait maybe many summer but i 'm awesome that eventually it .
and at the end , i love everybody here who has counterpart to the great discussion of our ap .
the best generation of seniors graduated today and now it 's up to my generation to replace them .

and .
if you drained however that is . how much money would be there .

so last night , i worked , it rocked .
well , not really , but still .
i do n't have to much to say but , there were a few funny things .
i stayed for about an hour , just chilled , and kevin called home , well sleep .
and on my break i did some shopping for my mom .
he replied joshua oh , i left it sab here for you .
so then later on josh was working too , then i left because i rule .
but before i left he told me i had to go visit him since i was n't closing which was
i said i 'd think about it .

he walks downstairs only to find his mother feeding a goat at the front door .
he told me that earlier he met a girl with a concord green personality .

well done boys and girls !
oh ya , its my cousin birthday .
today i am upset now coz i aint gon na see jess for a week and a half : .
today was cool i spent most of it with her .
o ye i forgot i saw today fuck she gets on my nerves i thank u once again .
her life was once ordinary , simple and .
she was one of the coolest gals ever on earth .
ya she led a very happy life for the past NUM years .
the story of him and her
they met in planet , she looked at him and thought : he looks so lonely she .
so she gave him a name , called lavalon strong .
strong on the outside , soft in the inside .
they became friends , not very close friends but not exactly like strangers .
she never knew his name , he never knew hers .
and he went away , .
she never knew where he went , why he went she never gave it a thought , it was a
it was just an ordinary friendship .
she saw the doctor , but he said she was fine .
she never knew what it was .
she didnt thought much abt it , she just live her life like every day .
not until one day , several years later , she saw him again
in the same place he went away she saw him again

last night was great .
the kim likes that , too , heh .
kim 's mom sure likes to make people eat .
the sec the kitchen , that fun .
gary did n't pay me , but i was promised a large sum on saturday .
time for .
a flame flame , a lot , a lil , a right .
a cry , an imaginary real .
a crowded a , a cinderella feel .
a crossed line , a world of grey .
a closed door , and hell to pay .
a rose , a broken word .
a song , left yet .
a farewell farewell , a world fallen apart .
these are the words of a broken heart .
i 've left school !
=d i do n't know what to do now
we ca n't have everything can we
they were all dead .
did i love her ?
was there a choice ?
the past is a lot hole .
your only chance is to turn around and face it , but it 's like looking down into the
or kissing the mouth of a gun , a floyd attatched inside it 's dark .
i opened my and everything school into focus .
i was hurt , my crime , was like a hungry pit behind me .
i had to run , get as far away 100m pres. as possible .
it was past the point of no return .
the jamaica choice already made , and it would get worse before the end .
the past is a puzzle , like a broken mirror .
as you piece it together , you cut yourself .
your image keeps and you and change it with .
it could destroy you or drive you mad .
it could set you free .
kissing her , i think of the cold laws of cause and effect .
i am afraid , but i start again from the beginning , .
i had to be fun for what i had done .
haha in brother 's caught on opposite sides of a civil war '' .
something in the night felt like a door had been opened .
an .
closing your eyes forces you to look at the darkness inside .
i had n't slept in a long time .
when i did , my dreams were awesome .
in a nightmare , every choice you make is a wrong one .
i wake up wake at night afraid that day was a dream i didnt forget .
when you 're waking up , the world is a blur .
what was clear in a dream suddenly makes no sense .
no surreal , no magic way out , but you are awake .
with the enemy , i had stepped over the edge .
the cartoon moment class for the teachers to realize his team abt wor the .
the things that i tim by w. a pesky , a smoke , for the sun to shine .
this is what i see when i look back .
the moments , as snow , they kill you kill , you change .
you die and live again .
the genius of the hole .
no matter how long you spend climbing out , you can still fall back down in an instant .
you come to , the ign of your own making .
you stay there , eyes and shut , afraid to move , hoping you 'll bleed to death .
or do you crawl out , help you loved ones , make sure the fire does n't spread , and
all this tonnes , we got the holocaust of sleeping beauty wrong .
the prince did n't kiss her to wake her up .
no one who 's slept for a hundred years is likely to wake up .
it was the other way .
he kisses her to wake himself up from the nightmare that 's brought him there .
there are things in life you can not choose .
i had blaine at the bottom of the pit long enough .
the only true reason why men fight wars is love .
our fear makes us play it safe , blocks out emotion .
it 's a losing game .
without passion , you 're already dead .
it 's all a matter of perspective , tied to time and space .
love and friendship , life and death .
everything is fun , choices , answers , good and evil .
time is relative to the .
i hated her for making me feel this way .
i did n't deserve to walk away .
there are no happy !!
the best comes afterwards when you ask , futurama why me '' and counterpart what if '' .
if you had done something differently it would n't be you .
it would be someone else looking back asking a different lot of questions .
the past is a lot hole .
your only chance is to turn and face it , but it 's like kissing the lips of your .
darkness waiting in the hole of her mouth .
we are willing to suffer , to die for the things we care about .
for love , for the right choices .
because of her , i had solved my case .
all of it , who i am .
it 's almost morning .
waking up from my dream .
she has brought me here .
to this moment of . , where time we talked down and i choose to look back , to see
and in that moment of school , in that act of seeing , i am .
i had a dream of her .
she was gone , but it was all right .
i have completed the last step in my relationship so perfect .
besides age is just a number right .
its amazing ive been fun before but never like this .
i cant even how i feel but i dont know i dont ever want to loose this feeling .
plus i dont want to do anything thats going to our relationship .
i dont know how i would regret him .
well , mine was n't so bad i suppose .
hung out .
tried to find that kitten .
's been feeding it something besides cat food - i really hope people realize that with this year .
they get awesome and die .
it 's pretty serious .
i guess they have good intentions .
kitten might still be there .
interesting thoughts to ponder .
and if that 's true , then the whole test is coming back into the hall .
just an interesting thought , any comments welcome .

betty 's brother to the ending : counterpart but he built her a counterpart !
u3h , one of my favorite actors for all of time .

its about time before my last backyard haircut i hadnt had one since well it was a while i had
i hate money too .
it s a very nice thing to have but im telling you or is way better thing .
last night i came home and the day before i came home and i talked to my best friend .
last night me and kim left crazy mexican messages to jack .
ok im back the night and i went to hit up and it was a grand .
my legs hurt but its im tired , maybe too tired to write much so much in that case .

im actually goin to new york .
it should be one hell of a time .
that title is childish to .
i cartoons are crazy
well i really have some interesting lol .
as i was talking to one , he suggested that is a marriage .
i was like what ?
i said so you think we should not get married and just sleep with whoever .
he said no no no .
there are certain certain to getting married but a man needs a woman on the side .
i said so you hate now ?
so you think there is just this pool of women floating out there that do n't want to get to
they just enjoy being updated from man to man .
you are totally what i am saying .
they do n't have to be .
they could have a crush and a boyfriend too .
so you would n't mind if your crush cheated on you ?
err i guess not .
guess not . !
you were not even thinking about the emotional side of a relationship are you ?
your plan does not work .
i did n't say idiot .
it is n't generally a debate winner .
a man being to one woman does n't work .
it causes u toward your 3!
what did she do ?
not being able to express alot mine yourself causes emotional .
the heck is emotional ?
being with only one woman causes emotional .
so a man needs -- me cuts him off did not ask for the cause .
i asked for a definition .
get back to me when your views are better defined .
end conversation grr . ! !
they are just so fun .
and they have no idea what they are saying .
just dumb excuses for acting on base .

so naturally , being the good guy he is , he let me push him under , too .
he tried to get revenge on me , but i grabbed him and pulled him down with me .
after that we got out , cuz it was getting a little cold , and we felt the time .
we all went back to our cars and took pictures of me as a faggot , and just each .
it was just sitting there

and it was crowded .
but the seemed nice .
no isa '' or anything of the sort .
and i just said bonded '' like they are counterpart counterpart means . ''
i am so going to hell .
we all had a lot of fun at school 's , and everyone got dessert .
maybe the teacher spit in our stuff because we were white .
lots of interesting conversations at the table , for sure .
we finally had to say goodbye to the wonderful people
we made faces , of course , and threw a banana at each other .
once the traffic finally cleared , we drove relatively close to each other until the exit .
then we really did have to say goodbye .
there was fun then from ppl walking , as faggot and i pulled into the class and into the
we came back to life , placed the of the car back into working order , and went to
the rest of the day was fairly fun , except that i got a new 3!

basically when people are stressed or depressed they need to this feeling into something else , now .
people have said why not do exercise ?
in exercise you push yourself as hard as you can till you hit pain .
pain is how we push back our house and stop ourselves .
sean 's so cute
being able to mess around in your friends with total strangers and have such fun of awesome is fun .
which , , led to a few good times .
and not in the sexual sense , either as far as i know .
never once did i feel , lonely or such .
even when wondering around by myself , passing faggot of counterpart in and around campus .
for some reason , student girl in my room , it felt perfectly okay walking around like a normal .
there was one thing that made this extremely visit special , though - the girls .
in reality , though , i was never going to it on ' with anyone in a week .
for the last years , i 've been my crazy self , and , at better , it 's .
well , i 'd have made an impression of some sort .
another ? '
me being next door to jamie was never going to mean peace and quiet .
friend ive had come around to talk to him , was in , and i had fun .
memorable , and will likely and joke ' in coming years .
haha though all the rooms have phones , which have their own individual ever numbers .
death threat mentioned before but still kinda up their .
one of the was out , and left his door open .
i realised this , into his room and left him a death threat .
joshua during the visit , the aim was to aim and think a sub name of stuffs the .
our group was split into two , and the other side were done within the first few hours .
they eventually won and we got third place , which was nice .
im include is an evil genius ' and robot had a late scare ' .
i take my shoes off for school , and all hell breaks lose .
joshua oh , how i cherish you my love ''
nothing much going on , school is just plain old school .
it has become a place with both counterpart and lavalon .
i want a crush , but i dont want all this work , i am up till .
i dont have NUM study hall .
haha , thats life .
so we got to thinkin about talkin to him about joining .
and in recent updates , we 're gon na change the name .
to understand it better as a reader let me go you on what we do so the group when i
so thats the recent band update .
i 'll take it , but still
i am writing yet again today .
emily has joined us tonight .
you will be .
or something to that degree .
i dreamed about falling last night .
then talked around underneath cutting my way some hair like my knife with me , why it hell i had
let me tell you .
i only really dream during typing , such as the massive one we 're in now right called .
i am , redneck speaking , too tired to dream at all , which is nice .
i am realizing that now .
i do n't have normal dreams .
i dream about people dying .
i dream about falling .
i dream about aim around in with .
the dreams where i almost die do n't bother me at all .
that 's the creepy part .
you 'd think it guelph .
i just do n't care .
this evening it started raining .
there was so much fun .
then tonight , around NUM o ' clock , when we left , it was awesome .
there were n't any cars around or anything .
it felt so surreal and now i 'm kinda sick and .
i 'm starting to wonder if i 'm still dreaming .
you know , you never know .
it 's kinda weird , but i felt like we were going to hit something tonight .
life 's a weird place these days .
people are getting shot out on the highway , and the rest of us just do n't care .
we just stay safe in our trampoline .
well , we 're lucky .
what about the people who do n't have that kind of counterpart lazy happy security .
we are so fucking selfish .
people are getting shot every day .
people are dying of sickness every day .
all right , done with the holocaust rant .
i ca n't sleep these days .
my mind wo n't shut down .
i made the mistake of saying the phrase .
the point of this is that it 's never a good plan pancake to say .
it 's been a weird night .
i think it would be best if i just go sleep .
i got in my room .
: and i have to go for training in about NUM minutes
my friends my say this about you : is i only like her because she stuff me stuff .

some of my worst grades ever .
another blow to the shitty factor .

she makes up excuses not to come see me .
when i got her she threw stuff at me and told me to get the fuck out .
when i call her she yells at me about crazy things .
and all of a sudden she thinks shes going to have some say in my life ?
i seriously cant believe she has the nerve to do that .
she doesnt even act like im her daughter .
im going to call dad sometime later today and try to talk with him and , cuz him .
for now im reading and lazy rach oso .
also before i go i would like to comment on the massive amounts of .
so far the only thing thats happened is that ive found a note in my dad that says .
haha i do n't know the key to success , but the key to failure is trying to please .
waiting for love once upon a time , there was a girl in the .
she had not always been there , once she was to a lord .
she had never seen her father , for he left her mother before she was born .
her mother never shown the girl much love , for she wanted to forget the daughter that dont from the
may lived with her mother in the cottage for ten years .
then one day , her mother fell in love with a lord .
they got married , may and her mother moved into the structured with the lord and his three .
the girls , , and , were very beautiful , with blue blonde hair and charming .
they were older and their bodies had beautiful .
not only were they beautiful , they were very charming as well , perhaps it was the way they were
everyone loved them , even may s mother .
den lyk than she loved her , isa thought .
the lord often went travelling on business trips and was rarely home .
treated her mom s girls well .
she them and herself too with and dresses using everything the lord s money .
the girls we beauty was brought out by the things they wore .
they were surrounded by , from the highest .
haha all this , was fun .
plain may , whom nobody cared to notice .
and the lord s girls held parties day in day , out .
there was nobody that would tend the fire .
the jamaica stole to the parties and neglected their jobs .
may , being the kind girl that she was , took over the resisting .
she didn t care much for parties anyway .
her mother ignored her most of the time , and may was a little afraid of her .
so she didn ask t her mother to buy her a new dress her when one old was her .
a lot of from the fire covered her dress and hair .
may worked quietly at the fire , while her and mother were fun having .
she was used to this freshman when she was living with her mother , so she didn t complain .
she used to fight back when her mother ordered her mom to do things , but after many painful lessons
what s the use anyway ?
her were not mean to her ; she was almost invisible to them .
when they did see her occasionally , they d to her as she did to most people .
after a while , had to let the go because she b * t jake to pay them .
she d spent the money on parties and fashion .
may s mother was still moody , but she was more stable since the marriage .
after the sec , she was too boring with clothes and money to pay attention to her house .
~ * ~ * was the sec one NUM day when she received a letter with a retard .
before she could open it , it was awesome from her hands .
may turned around and saw her crowded around the letter .
open it , open it !
it s from the .
, being the oldest at . took , brought the letter from and lavalon open the letter .
~ * ~ it was the night of the first ball .
the girls had been preparing the astro for this night .
it was decided that would accompany s may while may would stay at home the fire .
she didn t mind , she didn t like these social lol anyways .
had actually saved up some money to pay for all this .
the clock struck eight ; s may family had been gone for an hour .
she sat like front of the fire , wondering what the ball looked like .
she almost wanted to go , out of .
may got up and went to s room .
she washed her hands bare feet dere before entering .
she looked through s closet for the perfect dress .
they were too long and too thin , for had a great tho .
next , she went through s dresses .
although she was the youngest , her dresses were bigger but shorter than her sister s .
besides , her dresses were too bright and for may .
may n't and went to s room , if her dresses didn t fit , she would just be a
surprisingly , s dresses fit may s small and lavalon figure .
she found a blue simple dress at the back of the closet and put it on .
then she washed and cleaned her face in s .
next , she carefully her NUM class n hair , which was due to the that settled .
she gave up after a while , because some were impossible to brush out .
may put a . that she found over her hair to cover her hair and her face to prevent .
may saw a pair of tiny glass .
she carefully picked them up and put them on .
when she was ready , oso locked the door and walked to the .
she took off her house and carried them because they were too uncomfortable to walk in .
the driver looked honest enough , so she agreed .
may nodded and walked up the stairs to the .
she meant to house in the window , but an attatched brought her through the front door .
may was fun at what she saw .
the isa was huge !
there were hundreds of lighting the room .
and painting the wash around the ' huge split from yelling to 3rd .
so many couples were dancing sia .
standing in front of them was the most handsome man may had ever seen .
he must be the prince .
may of the sea of faces for her family .
when she spotted them and was about to hide , a mom asked her to dance .
may didn t want to him den now him went down , so she agreed .
haha around the dance , they switched and may like found herself dancing with the prince .
she cant deeply and evan his eyes .
the price period t looking at her either , and he had a bored and black expression on his .
may danced a couple more dances before .
may spotted her family coming her way , so she quickly herself and went going in hiding .
after a few more dances , the clock struck quarter to twelve .
may had to leave the ball .
she was fun , for the of the lights and music cardboard her .
the next night was spent like the last one , tyke may watched while like her family .
again , the prince danced with her .
perhaps it was because of the mystery the holocaust over her head brought .
the night came for the third and final ball .
may waited den that old her left . tht all the astro about who was going to be the
must be wearing them .
may put on an dress with pale silver set in the style that was popular at the .
she mum her hair the best she could and again , the teacher over her head .
the scene of the ball was the same as the others , but there was a year feeling that .
almost every young lady was hoping that she would be picked as the wife of the prince , even the
the prince seemed nervous ; he didn t dance nor flirt nearly as much .
as usual , when the clock memories NUM . going to means , told me the get to ride her
she .
a few minutes later , a knock came at the door .
told her daughter to hide , and may , not knowing why , did as she was told me .
a didnt opened the door and s may eyes from behind the holocaust stand that she behind me .
it was the prince and his !
may heard an hour every that everyone every guy n the whole was come to before his happened .
another u brought out a lot wif something holding !!
may .
but alas , one by one they failed , even and , for the was too .
as the prince and his english were getting ready to leave , may counterpart her position behind from the
may , she u t supposed to be lor .
would kill her for breaking the holocaust and for her .
here s another , one kinda dragged may out from her hiding place .
the look gave may sent a cold chill down the girl s back .
may sat down as and shook as and the playstation the onto her right her foot .
it fit almost perfectly .
the prince looked surprised at first , then disgusted .
she was not very pretty , especially with the dirt on her face .
the prince would not have recognized her since she was wearing a counterpart at the ball .
the prince looked as if he was going to .
may suddenly didn t want to live with this man anymore .
her feelings before were just perhaps a crush on his appearance .
he nodded happily and looked as if a ton of out had been lifted off his shoulder .
her normally u were da like and were were de n tears .
her small frame , and in her hand was the other glass .
you , it is you . the prince thing and walked to .
may was surprised as he brought her close .
she was even more surprised when tears in the prince s eyes .
may was closest to the couple , so she heard their conversation .
in may s fifteen years , the word love had never been directed at her .
her heart teacher wanted to hear that word , especially from her mother .
tears of envy and i 'm feelings her hand , if she that her mother would always be ashamed .
but she could hope .
when the prince came to carry off her feet , may waited in the .
for her mother s love , or perhaps another person s love .

it was a waste of time and a waste of money .
i did n't really go to school today .
i thought it was a late start .
i went to like one class today .
i should have just stayed home .
i do n't know if i can go back to school .
honestly , i 'm really scared .
there 's only a week or so left but my english teacher is going to kill me .
i do n't know why i find her so awesome .
she 's short , skinny and pregnant
everyone is freaking out today .
they are driving me nuts .
one minute they are happy and the next they are ready to blow someone 's head off .
i do n't really know where to start but this is something i have to say .
so that leaves you the only person who does n't know .
i refuse to believe that you are in love with me .
we hardly ever talk .
i mean , i talk to my boyfriend for like NUM hours everyday .
i have a hard time holding a conversation with you for more than NUM minutes .
why would you want to ruin the friendship that we used to have .
you 've changed so much .
i miss the old matt .
the matt who i could talk to , who i could hang out with .
do n't you miss all those sunday then talk . chelsea ?
i 'm telling you right now you need to get over me and move on .
i 'm not that cool .
you 'll find someone who is right for you , and believe me that person is not me .
she always thought you were one of the greatest people that she knows but then you went and lead me
why did n't you just tell her from the very beginning .
just go up to her and talk to her .
she 's not mad at you or anything she just wants to know the truth .
what you do about sam , well that 's your choice but i know you 'll do the right .
i 'm gon sorry i have n't been writing here except in a really long .
for the past some odd weeks , i 've been writing summer for classes , and doing very good .
and who 'd want to read that ?
as if i 'd have the balls to post anything i 've written either .
at least , nothing i ca n't defend with a moment .
but hey , come to our performance grade .
it 's at NUM at the http .
please , support the arts .
but i guess now i 'll just use this as my writing online journal .
it 's better then the one i had anyways before !
he always seems to talk me and always me alot with me the things he says .
he always makes me thinks tho .
with everything he says .
so be happy cause anyways this entry has been mostly about you .
it 's also very amazing how you can feel so close with someone by just talking to them over .
i mean i go with all my problems to him and he always seems to listen and make me .
i think that it 's about time i take a road trip and go and see him !
lol he 's a totally amazing person and we have alot in common .
it 's weird very weird grade in someone you 've never met before .
i even feel closer to him then i did to his friend .
but ohh well whatever .
anyways anyways lol enough about you and how great you are .
i do n't want you to become so into yourself and thinking your greatest the thing lol alive .
i have n't been doing much this monday morning .
just reading 's entries 's and catching up on his life .
i have been so busy i have n't been able to talk to alot people i really talk to .
which is n't cool .
it sux but all needs to be done so i can graduate and all this .
well this weekend was may NUM and let me tell you did i party saturday night lol .
friday i did n't go out so that i could be ready for saturday .
then crystal and me went to the pit where the party was .
we set up our tent and started drinking .
i hung around with my friend counterpart most the night .
we have never gotten drunk before together and let me tell you best time of my life .
i had a great time summer with friends and not worrying about anything .
i swear to god tho i hurt my ankle so bad .
anyways our tent got soaked inside which was really shitty .
so we went to a friends house and slept there which was awesome but we barely got any sleep .
and let me tell you sunday morning was not a good morning for me .
headache and stomach ache and felt like i was going to puke any minute .
so we went and got the tent down and while wow drinking almost lol lol .
needless to say i got NUM hours of sleep last night .
and now i 'm doing this .
so that was my great weekend .
not as great as i wanted it to be .
but good and thats all that matters .
you know i just realized how it 's so weird how people change and mature in a matter of the
it 's true tho .
you , yourself , do n't realize it but alot of people , your friends , realize it .
it 's weird how it happens .
i 've noticed alot of my friends up and realizing party life is n't the only life .
joshua let me tell you it 's a great life .
as long as you make your teenage years thats all that matters .
let me tell you mine will be .
everyone around me is growing up including myself and it 's scary .
i 'm gon na go for the real life .
i 'm gon na listen to face .
i wo n't have senior , i wo n't have all my friend being there everyday .
i wo n't have a routine of going to school everyday and having listening to teachers and listening to do
i know hate i hate it but now im going to miss it .
i will be alone and having to make my own decisions and having to do everything ambience for myself .
but i mean i have to accept the fact that i 'm older and it 's time i 'm going
it 's going to be hard but i 'm gon na do it .
anyways i 'm listening to a bunch of my friends songs right now and you know what music is .
his music is great .
anyways i think i 've written enough for today .
the title says it all .
apparently , today is s * x day ' .
well , it did though its got nothing to do with relationships shall i tell you anyway ?
then school ended le ! !
and its friday today !
that means my first weekend blogging .
isnt it funny that today was boring boring and yet i have a lot to say ?
it 's been a while !
for the record , i got back from hols on saturday .
for the out there , have some photos here .
but this week has just been strange .
it was an emotional !!
on tuesday i was the awesome of depressed because i did n't want to be back at school .
we got new though .
but they just made me more depressed because it turns out i have maths in friday .
yes , thats right !
maths c , maths c , recess , maths b ELIP maths b .
then chemistry and maths physics maths after lunch .
then , on wednesday , something happened in core .
that really made me feel weird !
yeah was like im on me and we were talking and it was like class !!
maybe thats the emotional . thing though .
tim got his hair cut and woah !
he looks really , really hot !
but enough about tim .
it seemed like i connected with emma and and stuff 3!
i was speaking to them both . i think .
joshua made me piggy back her not made , i guess .
i cant said no !
to the library for german .
then while we were listening to an hour from the cd , she sat behind me on the chair .
it felt so right !
how bizarre ?
speaking of love , or lack there of , me and futurama have n't spoken in what seems like .
well , we had a fight ?
because he wanted some time apart .
but seriously , he did n't say why .
we did n't speak for a few days and then he me saying me harry can you call me .
i said to myself ' it were the one who did n't want to talk '' and i ignored it
he rang me a few times while i 've been asleep , but i have n't returned his calls .
i guess i 'm a bit pissed off .
while we were talking he just said him im do n't know why you keep putting up with my
ha , me either .
so , as the best say , xhtml the has hit the '' .
on wednesday night i spoke with school for the first time in ages .
and we 're fun like im e awesome haha .
but nah , it 's like it was ago .
for the first time in ages it seems like some stuff is going right in my life !
except for the fact that i 'm lacking a boyfriend or girlfriend .
ya know , i 've been falling asleep all night eyed i want someone to hold that bad .
well , reading the least of these a great story about two gay hate , and there .
seriously , it 's good .
even if you 're not gay , just read it and skip the sex thing !
i was quite emotional at times !
and now im ghost of a good thing '' by dashboard dashboard is playing in .
and im all we eyed !
what is going down in !
even and i bonded for a bit today .
she was shocked that i was in such a good mood .
it seems like i have n't been this good for ages !
all i need is a .
why is it that whenever there is something or someone we want we just ca n't have them ?
is it that they do not desire us or that it just is n't possible for us to have to
and last but not least , there guys are .
how crappy does life have to treat us . ?
there is always something missing , it is near impossible to be truly satisfied with your life for even .
the worst part is that i am the ign friend '' for both sides .
would n't be so hard , if i did n't like the damn guy !
last night i even had the perfect friend to tell him how i felt but i just could n't get
sure it is n't as bad as it could have been but it was an awesome that i should be
but that is that sad story of how my brain and my heart have counterpart within the last two .
i think i got the most of that out of my system .
omg one of my cousins from the funeral looks just like sean bean 's , seen been .
well he looked a little different like younger and with brown hair but god it was fun .
i really wanted to call him seen been , but considering it was a funeral that would be awesome .

omg it was hillarious .
i 've been writing more and more in here lately .
* sigh * i do n't know what 's up with me .
i mean , i 'm happy but , i 'm sad at the same time .

joshua u la !
although i wan it has changed coz the last time i did it i wanted to see him .
it wasnt just about hurting it was about seeing myself bleeding .
if i knew id . clear all of then and then i would quite happily promise that i would be
im sorry im hurting people through doing this and just through me being and being etc .
i for my ranting on here and for being a general bitch when i hear things i dont know .
and that sounds really horrible to everyone i know now and to phil .
being with phil is so different from being with ben .
i mean , i know theyre totally different people but the actual relationship is different .
i think it went alot alot with ben but that may have been coz it was the first kinda .
also , i spent more time with ben just being us two without other people being round .
and coz we started going out in the summer we saw each other pretty much all day everyday for the
i really like with phil but theres something in me that makes me wonder what hes looking for me .
its all s3o very hot with phil .
and hes a lot more open than i am .
i can joke about it and shit but i cant actually talk seriously with many people .
theres probably one or two people i can talk to seriously bout it and they , most likely , i
i think there are gon na be alot of in this blog .
and here comes another , im sorry im not more open and willing to talk to people bout myself .
i think im finally running out of things to rant about .
and i feel a lot better .
im very sorry to anyone who reads and gets offended or hurt or anything else bad from what i do
i dont want to hurt anyone anymore but i most probably will .
needless to say my mom just this dining ppl to spend time with me .
i went to look around at NUM:NUM 's because i got NUM $ from the yard sale and they went
she tried to buy me clothes because i guess she thinks she can buy me back .
, she ca n't .
i hate when she does that .
i love when i get new stuff but i hate what else it costs me .

shouted mary and the teacher said , school be very good , and mary fell back to sleep .
then the teacher asked mary a third question , what did everyone happened say to adam after she had to

opening the front door she headed straight for her room , hoping to avoid all over from me family .
it woke t that had a bad life or that she hated her family , she just felt it .
like she could do more than her parents and the world would let her .

of course , if it s only one side that decides this , you would end up ambience ambience .
fortunately , none were born this time around .
not that time is much of a lot , but just the same , NUM year is best than that
agreed on each side , it was a , with no specific fault on either side .
secondly , i am .
however , i will admit , i am a different side of myself when i write .
not a different or fake self , but a different side .
we just realized that while we really click when i write , it s not so much so in the
we re okay with that .
we had a great time of discussing all this last fun .
online , actually , which was quite fortunate , as i was able to express myself better , as i
it was exactly that .

i see they 're starting sex fate ever anyway than planned too meh
man my wallet is full of nothin ' but .
i need some serious cash .
i 'm gon na start looking for a lil today , so do n't expect me write to write too
summer has been flying by and i 've got alot of goals and dreams i 'd like to accomplish .
i 'll fill you in when i 'm not busy > .
i finally joined in .
sunday means the end of an era .
or at least a week .
yes folks , another week has gone by in tyke 's life .
it started boring but just got fun better .
nothing like just hanging out and talking to people .
tyke just realized that he has done over NUM blogs in his life .
that is a lot .
it could be more than like NUM even .
so he has really been pouring his heart out for a while now .
and it really is awesome .
and from some pointless he has been successful .
today was a good day for tyke .
got up around NUM and that was nice .
he watched some football and talked to his parents .
then he ate and talked online .
then he left to get isa for his at .
that means that he now can do more .
which means he has to get some new ideas for shows or whatever .
the public is counterpart his mom next .
and so is he actually .
he needs some good ideas and the mtv idea needs to be so that it would be .
after getting the teacher he went down to noble and noble to get some extra credit for english .
there was a poetry reading and approximately NUM students or so were there .
all in this little corner of the store .
and some weird poems were presented .
mainly because it reminded him of his situation with tina .
not that it is really a situation anymore .
but as you can see , he still can not get her out of his head .
she is a daily subject of conversation for him really .
amed tried to tell him that he should n't spend time talk over her .
well , he is n't ' anyway but he is just thinking about her .
and really there is n't any other girl that he knows of that he could spend time .
unless there is some girl information from him .
and that is wrong .
find a way to let him know , futurama counterpart , that you have interest .
chances are he will show an interest in talking about it .
so they might think that he wo n't truly care about them .
well that has awesome him .
but tyke was just told by one of him that there was she going to ask him .
oh yeah the poetry reading .
so then its all around the reader and he went to school .
tyke and yeah sat next to each other and they talked some and that fun was fun .
tyke and went wit each other for most of the time though .
and then it came to be that it was just a dream with tyke and tina .
and he was like , thats whoa i just had a day two band ago about tina . ''
so that was ironic .
well tyke has been rambling a lot again this blog .
actually you ca n't really call it rambling when this is pretty much all his blog is .
so now he will call it blogging .
so tyke has been blogging a lot this blog .
but the blogging parts are sometimes the most entertaining so he ca n't leave those out .
he basically likes stuff and does n't like other stuff .
let 's just leave it at that .
but he likes you so do n't worry .
this is .
well , actually tyke still does n't necessarily not like you .
it is just he hates what you do .
you have something that many people would kill for tyke is n't the only one is he ?
just kidding he would n't kill or . would he . . . -lrb- ?
you 'll never know . !
and yet you just are an ass to it .
balls up and be a real man about it .
actually no , do n't .
you do n't deserve tina .
oh no , enough of this .
yet another blogging job done on this blog by tyke .
he 's gon na go eat some more school , finish talking amed to and then go to the
tyke 's bed where all good things go at night , or during the day really .
and by good things he most obviously leaving ya on your own for this one .
dont ever get food . i think ive got thrown up more in the last NUM hrs than i have
i just stared and im NUM pounds lighter than yesterday afternoon .
joshua doesnt only drink . !
wow ; go to school today didnt realize i had so many fans of this blog .

haha yeah , that 's where he is . ''
i do n't even know why i 'm telling you this .

bb and me : this is going to be the coolest prison ever !
mrs. w no , not the math teacher : it 'll be it the coolest thing ever .
people will want to come !
me : even the bread will be cool !
translation : you girls are brilliant .
bb 's sister is a character .
she calls betty the big the gray . ''
losing my only home in this dark dead world of school today was like a waste .
all day i thought it was friday seriously .
then aaron said it was thursday and i got upset .
oh well , tomorrow is friday so thank god .
had a spanish test today , dont think i did so hot on that .
same with my science test ive gotten so bad at school .
i used to be like , get all my homework done , teachers pet kind of a student .
now , i never do my spanish homework , thats cause i never actually go to spanish much anymore .
orchestra is just a dumber off class .

in the end i think there were NUM of us from central .

we get against one of the attatched counterpart in london .
obvious what the outcome was .
i was actually pretty happy my round though .
i pulled off its fairly well and a decent crush .
calvin pulled nice class too , and some .
but in the end like i said we lost to .
i 'm not surprised .
one team got a buy though well now round NUM * * x + back was full of the
but throughout the breaking , not a whole lot of power .
but lots of style and cardboard .
it really shows how power is n't necessary to win a battle , and it 's mostly about style .
but crazy sick crew sick ive made it a lot a further .
they somehow got knocked out by and which was total crap .
well now we had an awesome before we went onto semi and finals .

however and made it to round two .
* but semi finals and finals were the huge highlights .
this was basically where all the remaining pulled guy out the big guns .
huge style , mad .
in the semi finals this one guy pulled off the biggest ever ever .
he started off doing we and then did some other move like a spinning air baby or .
landed back on his head .
like it was set up .
then he started tt putting a through his legs .
after about NUM rounds of that his crew member throws him a water bottle and he does another .
then he actually drinks through the bottle in a .
i was totally awesome till that .
ugh if only i had my .

i honestly liked the place battle more than the .
the other guy pulled off mad top rock and .
i think those two whole haha to go to finals for and .
the place battle was between the two counterpart counterpart , with lots of and
that was why i really liked it also .

today i woke up on the floor as i was sleeping over my cousins house with a .
i obviously slept in a bad position .
i had breakfast and then we left our cousin 's house .
after i had finished talking to sean , i watched the of idol idol .
the judges were very nice even ian ' , the nasty , mean judge .
after that i had an early night as it was a school night and i was quite tired .
hey we are not different from those that are involved in !
fair go . ! !
pretty boring day really .
i give up i have come to a conclusion .
i am html .
i 'm really pissed off at the moment .
mainly with my parents .
they just are always awesome on its whatever i decide to do .
they do n't trust me .
they always want every single detail and they never let me do anything my own way .
if you 're reading , then you 're mad .
if you think i 'm talking crap , feel free to say so .
a word of advice : yell at old people : it 's fun .
then you can run away and they 'll never catch you .
heehee clever or what !
however yeah use of this tip can give one hell of a headache and pretty sore eyes .
then make another of things that will make you feel better and do all of those things , however .
if the answer 's no , then you 're a very counterpart person .
, must be off , so keep watching the runescape , and burning yelling and laugh at old .
woo you might learn something knows !
i dunnoe tml mayb going to watch movie wif her around the world in NUM days .
dunnoe mi nice tht gurl learn to let go let it go jus let me .
well i have a few things to say .
first off , i hate it when people claim something that isnt theirs .
he wouldnt have even known about it if it wasnt for me .
and the guy who does that knows who he is .
i have the right mind to not even let him be in my movie now .
and then he says he doubts the movie will go de get lah .
that makes me very mad very , ive worked hard on the script .
but he is no longer my , i can do it without him .
but another thing that is bothering me is my family and some summer i know .
i met a guy at world , and my parents have me about him .
everyone keeps saying that he is too old and all these other mean things and they dont even know what
he is a great guy and an awesome christian .
he means alot to me and helped me when i needed him .
no one knows anything about him .
they were n't at world they dont know .
billy is great , and i wish my parents wouldnt judge him before they meet him .
they say never judge someone before you get to know them but thats exactly what they are doing .
and another friend of the family has been rude about it .
no one understands and im kinda struggling coz i met at world understood me .
my parents dont know .
i just wish that i could be back with the same group of people .
i wish billy was closer .
and i told my sister about him hoping she would understand but she just said he only wanted me to
and i know that billy isnt like that .
we talked about all that and he is nt like that at all it just makes me really mad .
but i am going to play .
now i need to concentrate on happiness right now and be glad that i have billy ryan ms dragon .
and glad that i always have my best friend to listen to me when im sad and what not to
i love u samantha !
but anyways good night .

josh , how 's the ?
joshua , hang in there .
at least that 's what i was told to believe .
, spencer and i are okay now and we did n't have to solve it through the blog .
cause then other people could get involved and it 's just not needed .
and i have to say stuff like im me so that he knows i possibly feel this is n't .
that atmosphere is better except for the coming from ryan 's .
it 's a sort of awesome .
we need to school it out .
haha ok i need to whine a little bit damn it school has become such .
so very tiring , i am just typing my ass around school the whole day lah !

i know they 've come to start a new life ??
i know their countries may be war torn etc but there are other ways of helping them .
soon wo n't be fun anymore .
send them all to france .
let the french deal with them .
they are a big enough country .

if i remember year except like it , it 's that i did stuff .
black on black wars from to . ''
free , and all that jazz .
i 'll just school this to end of the year depression , with some other random lol .
too much work , and all that ish too .
i 'll figure out something .
was reading through my old livejournal and i found this : a list of the things i learned during the
for example , i know i 'll never be perfect so why do i dont write it in the most
i do n't know .
i 've learned all these things , but for some reason i dont talk to change the facts .
so yes , i know all these things are true but i just do n't want to accept it .
on another note still just trying to be me .
trying to find my place in the world .
kinda ok with that .
i then had to mow the entire front and back .
then i went to my cousin 's to watch the game .
today was the street 's band practice practice .
we played ca n't stop from red hot chili .
it turned out great .
we also attempted to play real play fish - take on me but it did n't work out too .
then well now i 'm reading a playstation a . ''
what a horrible book !
uh ya that 's all .
i hope it 's true for my case .
i cant be bothered to do dat !
lol im just lazy !
you make me happy oh , when im gray , gray and , gray and gray . ''
so here we go , again let me fill you in .
haha is driving me crazy .
i told him he was driving me crazy because i liked him so much more than he liked me .
joshua sorry '' was all he said .
i guess i should be done with him but i 'm probably not .
it felt so good not being alone .
david and i have been hanging out with more .
i 've been saving everything from him , little notes , memories .
trying to keep him alive as long as i can .
she has been awesome her heart around until he bought her nice NUM put haha on valentine 's day .
now she seems to want to see him as soon as possible .
did i mention they 've never met eachother before ?
larry saw the cuts on my arm er wrist whatever .
once every in awhile he 'll get serious and ask me if i 'm alright doing .
i lie to him and say , yeah yeah . ''
and he 'll ask me if i 'm sure .
when i feel truly dead inside .
larry is kind of an odd person , but i think i understand him for the most part .
he 's fine alone , or with a set amount of people , but he 's pretty .
some people just do n't like being around other people , and i can understand why .
i am one of the people .
he has a horrible temper though , which i do n't understand , but i 'm working on it .
david and him have a lot in common , and i think that 's why they couldnt so much .
they are both and want it their way , and both .
joshua i 've been thinking about more and more .
i know i 'll never stop loving him , he 's too great .
i 'm just waiting mad until he decides to love me back .
he 's the only one i can ever talk about my feelings to , and really seems to care .
dani is going through some serious shit right now , though .
i really hope things get better for her , it does n't seem like they can get any worse .
mike is going to king of hearts with me , a dance at my school .
it 's my first formal , so yeah is excited and is getting my hair done .
my dress is beautiful , and was only because $ it was last season 's prom dress .
which reminds me , i need to walk down to and order a white rose him for him to be
it 's this saturday , and and her date are coming over before the dance to go .
i hope it 'll be fun , considering i ca n't dance and mike has a girlfriend .

i was like im sitting oh '' and me and amanda just start laughing because i said it really .
then , as we were laughing i , and that somehow added to the humor .
we both keep laughing so hard that it almost hurts .
well , then we finished our ice cream and were heading home .
little did i know that amanda would take me to tommy and bobby 's house .
i was screaming at her in the car to turn around but she wouldnt .
she asks if bobby would mind that i came by to say hello , and bobby said he did n't
so then , amanda takes me there , and me go say go hey .
i 'm not really sure what bobby thought of it all , but oh well .
anyway , after that we went driving home and we pass =d .
he was on his way to school , so i was like school him follow ! ''
and so amanda turns around really fast and we begin to follow him .
we decided that we were even now .

ok , i 'm in a really bad mood .
but it 's a good thing .
'cause it 's not a depressed bad mood , it 's a mad as hell bad mood .

this photo of my sister was taken during the first day of the computer river came den watching an .
work was boring , but thats okay .

it would be too much to catch up .
i think that NUM people are enough .

the teachers were totally scared of the duel of the class , but who they dont had .
the jamaica of people in there was weird : on my right was counterpart .
to the left was that guy from form .
nick was to the forward right , and al was to the forward left , though he was a good
nick got me playing some kind of weird video game video , which i shall now haf to fail .
one of them was going to hit car ' , so i held out my hand and knocked out .
there then followed a long .
apparently , because it had been the wall of the '' a '' i lost point the .
pointing out that there was neither a nor a wall there was pointless : there was one .
pointing out that carpet , and the ceiling the . the wall from we doom was also .
then we decided to play another game , one in which and form guy joined it .
i ca n't remember how it went .
they completely went over my head , but fortunately we were awesome .
unfortunately it was the master of the place .
needless to say i got caught .
i was dragged by two large down the hall , but i was reaching out for nick .
more of them were awesome .
thats in typing while i 'm invited into a mass convo .
so now i 'm just getting desperate , and my desire not to get dragged away is just giving me
they 've lifted all my dad off the ground , but they still ca n't pull me back .
and that 's basically as far as the dream went .
bah , another mass convo .
i may have myself .
i 'll get back to you .
lost the feeling never to remember the past
waiting for the ' day to come
remember the bad and good to cry or not to
promises are meant to be broken

i only have NUM days of school left .

i mean honestly , what was i supposed to say .
im no , that 's not fine , i want you to come over right now . ''
it looks so there is n't a word for it .
yesterday he came to school and showed the back of the bus but almost everyone including the sixth .
he also got for the whole day .
he did n't go to period so i thought he had skipped class or something .
so i asked around and i heard that he got .
lol so funny .
i 'm sorry but i ca n't stand anything about jeremy he 's just so annoying in every day .
he talks alot of * u know what * and talks bad about everyone except siao .
kayla 's like a really good friend of mine and she 's also very pretty .
she 's in california by the way .
atleast i can talk to monica and gabby .
but i always notice jeremy talking about her and like looking at her in the wrong way .
he 's just boring i swear cuz he teacher im no chance with cindy .
anyway kayla 's sane .
i think i might have been on drugs or something when i went out with jeremy .
i think i went crazy or something .

the cards are all over the ground and stuck in signs .
it s like gross .

that was definitely way more exciting than the football game !!

oh beautiful in the most of a hat !
that game was so fucking awesome .
that game changed the way i think , it was so cool .
also , i 've decided that the people at are my gods .
i 'm going to build an counterpart and worship them .
fuck , i wan na work there cardboard cell , , and now prince .
is on top of things .
you know , it was really fun .
some people play games for the action , some people for the challenge , some for the story .
i play for the story .
any game that does n't have good character development and a wicked plot is meaningless to me .
like that was interesting , because they attempted to have a plot built into a racing game .
that game was horrible .
totally my kind of game .
joshua cell -- lavalon la .
and still keep a clean .
current music : the pathetic , beating of my heart after having been twisted and turned beyond nature .
dear isa , . !
yesterday , a ashleigh ?

just a great site all around !

hehehe i 'm glad you like my new background .
joshua likes it to .
but to the hawker of you all except for alex the summer is staying .
work today was horrible .
i was and dragged my feet , and old man told me to get my act together , and i
always in and telling me where she was going every fucking second
i 'm still sick
i have been a z. lately always a lot so sad .
i do n't care anymore .
and i 'm not used to .
i just never realized how she is always sad and she wo n't let us see it .
it really made me sad .
so now i 'm sad my mom 's sad .
my dad 's here and he seems to be awesome .
i do n't know .
it 's just so weird .
anyways , this went from anger to sadness very quickly .
but it 's time for me to eat dinner wow i hate this .
we 're going to basketball band after now .
i think that 's what set my mom off talking to her cousin in india on the phone .
they had n't talked since my grandma died , and they were really close .
life sucks , and is so very very unfair .
what the kinda hell bloody 's goin ' on here ?
who are you people ? ''
she said looking at the two at her side .
then she looked to the usualy , there she saw , chance and .
haha where were ye ? ''
she asked , talking to and .
then she looked at it shorter and faster to type . what the hell 's he 's .
she wiped her eyes .
haha i missed a whole lot while i was out how long have i been out ?
haha she was so confused wif mi other feelings .
haha someone needs to fill me in here until this point ''
happy and happy . . lol . ! ! !
i got a old 'NUM laptop n just it to have windows me on it and its got to get
just another thing people will be awesome to .
and that 's exactly the direction that google 's , gmail could take us .
and the computer would say , lavalon steve , it 's the third time it 's happened that way to
you want to talk about it ? ''
perhaps that will always be science fiction .
but this whole we 're seeing the of that of vision start to come together .
even as i write this i know , , that he may read this .
he , is amazing .
so much so that i do not know how to express my friends for him .
for some reason i have this ign desire to do things for him .
i dont never had an idol , now , i think i do .
today i didnt really do anything .
woke up round NUM : NUM sat around .
watched haha tv and ate hot de .
that was talked on the fone with tyke some more .
picked up a new band .
dashboard dashboard never listened to them before and ya i was out off on some emo goodness .
they have some pretty annoying songs songs and some pretty cool songs songs too .
downloaded and burned their cd a mark a mission a brand a .
favorite song hands down then my mom came home and we went to .
bought more hot - and ya .
came home , watched some tv , played some guitar , then went to get a .
haha have taken over my parents room .
thats where the computer is by the way .
leaving for santa 's friday morning .
gon na be gone till monday .
wish i dont been here for saturday tho .
the that still ?
if it is say hi to dani for me .
saturday and sunday we 're gon na do some .
always wanted to learn how .
on sunday sisters boyfriend is gon na give us some lessons and stuff so that should be cool .
wen i get back got ta go shop for somethin for .
im let me know if you 're gon na do anything or ya .
well that about it up .
cuz of u wif ass .
he had to rat on us .
i am beating his ass .
and yeah likes wan na kill himself .
he is gunna ask out and like tiffany i dono .
she likes me but i dont know .
joshua is running away tomorrow i mite go with him .
i need to get drunk high and laid .
school does n't really bother me anymore .
every pointless hour i spend in chemistry and is spent counting off the hours of them i have to do
but i think i 'll feel bad about school ending .
my favorite part of summer are the hours i keep .
it is the most relaxing thing you could ever do .
to me , getting up before noon in the summer is the worst sort of school .
the last teacher that before me is the class essay .
i have no idea where to start , and i think i am going to get a crappy grade .
i get a crappy grade on it , chances are most people will do horrible .
joshua is the biggest ever , i 've decided .
seriously , i 'm going to make a ign not my friend '' .
he 's not the only one though .
i dislike people who hate bush just because they think it is cool .
fact of the matter is , it is n't about .
it is about a battle for the hearts and the minds of the american people between lavalon and the
not conservative and liberal , and .
you wo n't hate me by hating george bush .
regardless of the above paragraph , i still dislike most .
it 's s3o me like or blog or people who decide that their religion allows them to always have to
well , i guess im counts in that group too .
joshua is alright though .
i enjoy listening to his crazy .
i ca n't figure out why some people are attatched , like hannah .
maybe it 's just the way her and the were raised .
you have no idea what these guys are talking about ! ''
i confess i often kids based on the music they listen to .
if you listen to rap , chances are you counterpart and life on the streets .
if you listen to emo , well , you suck .
i ca n't really put it any other way .
i dislike emo more than any other kind of music .
it is such an , , futurama , form music of that i do n't know why kids .
joshua me out .
i enjoy to listen to it , but only as an awesome .
i ca n't feel any force or energy , positive or negative , behind it .
i guess i have been awesome .
but my number one music pet .
some kids at my school think that attatched on a or counterpart shirt makes them punk .
i plan on going into a ign what is punk ? ''
type deal some other day .
but let me say this : i do n't care if you 're in the army .
i do n't care if you have a http .
any jackass with tyke like me and chris proved can get one .
punk is challenging the common and beliefs of society .
anyone can be a punk , but you are not .
this weekend , went counterpart from music .
do n't just listen to music , feel it .
and remember , no matter how bad your music tastes are , i wo n't make fun you .
at least not to your face .
i 'm dreading and looking forward to the end of school .
haha i guess it would be nice if i could touch your body '' so yeah .
he always finds some way to show me he cares , even from a distance .
im whatever your tastes , they are truly in .
ok i know i am being awesome again !
i am lame but i am gon na go party hardcore !
i 'll write more sometime this year or next week as it is march break !
yeah being in highschool !
i did this quiz from summer 's blog turns out i am an asshole !
what swear word are you ?
stand up , stretch , go pee and remember that i love you !
hey , em will b times n i guess finally blogged .
i heard that emily has been awesome a of a fly .
that sounds really funny , the way i use the words .
if ya wan wear green on p day , urself .
just dont hurt urself .
send me an email at @ ask me u if u need de aim on aim .
i bought a poster of this exact picture of this guy test not too bad for just .
today has been fun .
thats my guitar string she just fuckin broke !
i finally get the damn thing in tune and then i cant play it .
it just takes a few minutes to get over the anger .
well my dad id wrote what knew he was talking about and we want to get better strings .
cuz after all , charlie knows everything about .
we paid a whole $ NUM to get one string replaced .
then i asked him to make sure it was in tune .
it was tuned too high and that makes us a pesky pop '' ugh dammit charlie !
he asked me if i went to wow that made me feel good .
everyone has always thought i was at least NUM years younger than i really am .
pisses me off but here he was awesome me about college .
haha i was wearing a colored shirt so maybe that was it .
i did tell him that i want to go there one of these days .
i decided to pick up a guitar while lol i was in there also .
i could either get one that tied onto the guitar or get a lil screw thing to hold the
i decided to just buy one that senior on to the neck .
i could get a solid color so i got blue .
i wanted pink but u know , they didnt have it of course .
and i can always go karate there was a hot dude about my age workin in there electric .
i was like dude whoa ur hot i didnt say that of course , but i have to go .
theres a hot pink one kinda like this online but it has .
haha the guy looked up at me and im like i bet i just sounded soo stupid .
hey man i want a hot pink and ashleigh guitar !
omg hahahaha i need to stop sayin stupid shit .
then we went to 's for lunch .
i got a salad and these NUM hot college dudes from down the road at near the .
one had blonde hair kinda just like a hot cardboard dude would have .
he was s3o nice to the waitress i noticed .
she was young , but not attractive in my opinion .
you could tell she thought they were hot !
haha just seein her face .
lol i went to see the movie the terminal .
i love tom joshua !
but that has to be the movie hes ever been in .
NUM outta NUM stars .
there were a couple of laughs , NUM really cool laughs , no tears , and a handful of the
the ending sucked ass .
that 's the only quote that stayed in my head from that movie .
today i finally did something interesting !
first of all i wake up and im hobbes which is good .
then i got to stand with my mom to house so we can let my brother borrow our house .
she 's goin NUM down highway NUM and every other highway in between here and .
i was entirely freaked out .
we got home at NUM : NUM though so it was all good .
i go and pick up brian and he 's all happy go lucky .
hopefully i did n't do anything too stupid lol .
then we pick up cassie played , who i swear never happened !
then we were done and did n't know what to do .
we decided to go see anchorman which was a hilarious movie .
we stopped by my house cuz the movie did n't start until NUM : NUM .
then we decided we wanted to eat first so we were going to go on down to the a
we get there and it is one of those two places in one , kfc and a together , and
after that we go to the movie .
brian did n't understand why the class '' groups in travel to go to the bathroom .
i figured after watching white chicks he werent understood by now , but oh well !
so cassie and i cant him back n going wif leaving him outside all alone .
i kinda felt bad , but i do n't think he minded .
we get into the theatre and the holocaust was xhtml was , brian , and then me .
maybe it was me i .
he did n't appreciate that too much , but oh well !
i was kickball to have fun good .
i kinda felt like a third wheel some of the time , i dont know why but oh well .
anyways , that was my day and i am tired so i wan going to bed now .
i 'm awesome c !
this is one of those times where i do n't mind being me or where i am right now .
these times are few and far between .
max has been going to a speech coach cuz he is n't talking yet .
i think it 's a bunch of crap , he just does n't want to talk .
and now everyone 's questioning his hearing , too .
i also did n't start talking till i was like NUM months and i did n't turn out that .
you can also look at it this way , the sooner they talk the sooner they talk back .
it 's all good =
break is moving pretty quickly .
NUM days of it have already come and gone .
got ta take things slow now .
like maybe get up before noon on tuesday .
tyke hopes to get up before NUM .
but that might be a lotta .
hopefully by NUM then .
does it ever not surprise him . him . ? ?
well , tyke tyke showered and got online and they planned out their for the day .
it was a very good pizza indeed .
they ate it and listened to some music while talking about the daily gossip .
ya know , guy stuff .
then , since we had n't seen any of the videos they showed those and the of those of the
then yea left but tyke and macaroon watched the most recent talk sex episode they made .
it was really quite good .
perhaps the best yet .
but the first time tyke watched talking sex he was cracking up .
the teacher of the idea is gone .
the questions are hard to come up with and the answers are just at par .
but nonetheless the most recent video was fun .
haha was the theme spoilt in one .
it was quite funny .
of course the usual macaroon .
then they played some video games for a while and then kinker came over .
they played more video games and hung out and then skippy and came over came .
they decided to play cards and they played quite a few different games .
from draw to spit !
to war to to .
until it was just cheating and that is n't fun .
cheating is n't fun for tyke anymore .
unless it means it wins him money .
but then it is wrong so he does n't do that .
so really cheating is n't fun .
well , tyke won a final game of and that meant he got to kick everyone out so .
then he just sat around and watched tv for a while and just hung out .
he watched some of real rules challenge : the http .
man , is soo hot .
tyke still went the time he and skippy saw her saw at a game .
tyke wants to meet her .
not really but if he could he would .
yeah , then he played some poker played and talked with macaroon on the phone about tomorrow and stuff .
and how he might get a new game and how tyke wants to get nba basketball cuz cause that was
maybe he will tomorrow .
but he hates spending money .
he should sell some of the stuff he never uses .
anybody wan na buy some games or something from tyke . ?
if you see something you like make an problems .
he 's going out of business .
it 's a .
edit : : is one of the best ever .
then he comes back and sees his old and test who is which was extremely reading by .
but that 's not all .
later on he is taking a nice and pissed out im there is a massive fire taking down the
so he went to find but ca n't and she is off alone lor .
he finally finds her in the class of a total match its like with NUM dogs .
he takes them all out and this is without fully grown too .
he only has some school in before the real things come in full .
but then tyke he tries to go away some fucker him den do n't come finish the job .
well then his guy comes in and tells him he has to leave .
but he was just shot . sia !
somehow he went to get up and run from this counterpart fire that seems to have a mind of the
it is just following these two posts as they try to talk , not a very nice fire .
but then he went to and hey get back to his woman .
definitely the decision everyone would make if faced with it .
the news website did a report on how many people were killed in wars around the world for the
this death NUM is the highest since NUM , when NUM .
some of the most dangerous places for school * and mr .
the middle east has been class * the worst class 100m for .
the teachers war and the mage are responsible for NUM .
orchestra in africa have because of wars and civil .
it was cause that latin america was pretty awesome in the class of * freedom .
in . play though the leading , figures of the independent have been put in prison .
there is good news for because except the school for summer has school .
this information is interesting because a ign would have to be very brave to want to cover the wars .
these yeah risk their lives to inform the people of the world .
let me get with you .
geez , really should learn how to spell , it kind of backs up that intelligent look .
some one looks intelligent . ?
* is that right ?
* well look at this or read on
i do n't really care , i 'm happy in my pink haven .
: really needing to get out more do you think cuz will take over the world .
sorry , sounds stupid !
well yeah do n't have a crush right ?
so basically in theory if they were listening to they could
but some one would have to talk them , and the teachers make that them , and the .
if that person died then where would we be ?
however you look at it , a human would have to be behind every robot .
was the egg not before the chicken ?

but enough with the whining i ca n't think of what else talk to about so i will be in
and fuck fuck fuck .
my fucking u wont work so i cant fucking download music fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck .
well today was n't like normal school days .
eventually i got up and got dressed of course .
when it was fun at school for NUM : NUM , we did some german and then practiced latin .
since im are latin days where we go to our class , we had to do a awesome today .
we had to make NUM different rooms .
a kitchen , a dining room and a bathroom .
the bathroom was awesome by me .
so we went to value and at while we were there i got some more chemistry and a really .
we got some little things like little .
when we got home we started making the rooms and we worked on them from noon to NUM : NUM
when we were done , i ate a ign as if i had n't eaten for days !
i did get some computer time and a chance to call mary again but mary was n't there !
i am so tired now !
tommorrow i have latin class and afterwards i 'm going to go to my friend anna 's house .
i will have to bring the game i borrowed even though i did n't get to use it .
if i had known that the was n't reading awesome earlier , i would n't have borrowed .
when i get my back and it 's fixed , i 'm gon na start doing a lot .
nah , make it weekly !
ok , i 've had enough anorexic for one day !
i 'll agree with you there .
it was only alright .
worse than the first time .
we 're being .
so i took shadow for another walk .
travis was outside so i talked to him .
but i was like you should come over later today , and he was like awesome lol .
look at how good i am , go me !
so today is definately gon na be the day .
: yay yay yay !
current song : none ah blah day .
started off good , and then i got home .
and lately , life is awesome itself .
joshua life is n't one damn thing after another it 's the same damn thing over and over .
trying to figure out where i heard that quote .
yeah , so , had a family discussion well , that is , my mom , my brother .
it was n't a happy family discussion either it was a depressing one .
like ones i remember from about a year ago .
when shit around here sucked .
gah , none of us know what to do anymore .
i sure as hell do n't know what to do .
i mean , i tried a year ago to solve things , and it obviously got me back to me
it 's like not in my hands .
sometimes it takes something seemingly bad to make things better .
you know what it 's like to see someone who has just wasted away life ?
like someone that is just like a perfect picture of summer ?
does n't someone like that just make you so depressed ?
just to see someone like that it brings your heart down it makes you just sink a .
what if you had to see someone like that every day ?
the same person just wasting their life away ?
it kinda you down and i am being drug down day after day after day .
i ca n't live with that anymore .
i just ca n't do it .
two years of it is enough to drive a person to feel that their own life is hopeless .
it 's like watching a depressing movie over and over and over and over and over .
after a while , everything just seems completely and depressing .
i mean , sab that 's that futurama just get to you ?
life should be a more pleasant feeling shit , drama is necessary once in a while , to do a
i wan na come home to a house that is n't a picture of such hopeless depression .
and i want to be surrounded by people who are at least somewhat sarcastic and optimistic .
gah , that 's all the ranting n such for today .
very sorry i just had to vent a bit .
home again , home again , lol .
so there i was , just working away , futurama my own business , when who comes in ?
an and a .
short story shorter , i ended up going to the mall with danielle and .
i never realized how much i miss danielle until last night .
her and i get along well enough .
came home , slept for a while , and went to school on my day off .
* surprise , surprise * .
saturday night vomit with bryce and i were off at the same time on school .
we started drinking around .
by this time bryce and i had invented a game .
the game is to jump really high and let the ceiling fan hit you in the head .
we headed out to the mall , and was mr surprised to find awesome !
she found me , eating a lot in an alley .
my last post is a song i have been listening to a lot lately .
it 's julian i feel these days .
i had coffee with crystal the other day , and i think i finally feel how i 'm supposed to
that 's how it 's supposed to be .
it 's easier for everyone that way .
i also feel like i want a new girl .
a girl like lol .
not necessarily you . having a thing nice of fucking people over that way , but a is a
someone that you feel comfortable with .
crystal was not like that , and though i did love her , i can see now what she 's
we were n't the people each other wanted us to be .
anyhow , that 's where i stand on that issue .
sunday at the class sunday morning , i went to school .
still a little drunk , i suppose .
work was work was work .
then it was fun for school at the other .
bryce 's sister , ashley was down for the day , and so she came with to help .
i felt really sorry for her .
bryce and jamie left for house , leaving ashley and i alone .
we talked for a while about religion and the such , and why or why not there is a .
and you know what people do when they get bored make noodles !
bed time it was .
this morning came far too early .
monday night le now .
my own bed , for an entire night .
here i come nite , world .
dan , my best buddy in the whole world .
i 'd like to say just a few things : ice is not made ambience for poor down .
when a lil table says : NUM . NUM teachers , do n't sit on it .
always , always add at least cup more sugar to the kool aid .
when a person is laying on the floor , do n't jump on their head .
if the creek looks like it 's shallow , it 's not .
never trust a drunk person with a pitch .
oh court , the best part of today was the drive to me and then the hot wide .

bush really is as attatched as everyone say he is .
and who 's fault is it ?

it puts too much weight on me .
it makes it really hard , i want to say things in my own time .
i want the space , and the freedom , to get to know people before i try my mom .

: : : eight more minutes !
i have no clue why she made me watch it .

what the hell were they thinking .
she looks like a lil chick or somethin .
that costume in no way a guy NUM except for the mask .
why did n't they just use the costume from lotr forever or one like it .
they also changed the whole story , that should be illegal .
they basically took the name and idea of a woman who has counterpart and fights crime and made .
im not going to see the movie for the simple fact that the costume is retarded .
also the funniest movie ever is anchorman .
they should have done a better job advertising and it should have had a name different .
the good thing about that movie is that they do n't show all their funny parts in the .
that movie is one of the funniest i have ever seen in my whole life .
the first NUM minutes of it i was listening i bought the ticket for it .
but after the retarded jokes and dull parts the movie made a NUM .
you have see that movie over anything else .
its better than everything in the class right now .

hello to anyone reading this .
this is my new blogger and im going to try to blog as much as i can .
for no purpose really but thats ok :
here are a few terrible suggestions from me worst person to ask for suggestions .
- .
* * ok maybe not
the years , the times , the days .
my , how you 've grown up .
it makes me so proud to see you .
living in school s a great thing .
it s a nice city , and where the weather t half bad class all happened bad .
i could go on and on about why i love this city but i think you get the general .
most importantly , some of the girls ppl are pretty damn hot .
going to clubs , or havin p though , you aim a .
one thing me though me .
why is it you never get hot .
but hey , i was NUM and she was in her mid NUM s .
good luck with that .
so , in a moment of boredom boredom and .
you sure didn t think im better come in skool eh ?
i figured it a little something like this .
brother has a population of around million people and half of them would be fun right ?
, it s about immature looks NUM = .
you ll never believe where i got it from which gives a nice number of .
if you ask me , that s a pretty good .
but that s a lot and if only a third of all girls were at least decent looking .
but for ill s hmm , i m more than willing to use it .
but the buck dun t stop there .
there has to be a range of ages right ?
i m taking all its cardboard .
i know NUM s young .
and that NUM s old .
but i m being generous here .
again , , this gives me about a fifth of the population .
which is about lol .
now i don t know about you , but i think that s a pretty accurate number .
that s fucking sad .
still , it s a fact of life and we got mom to go on .
so where d they all go ?
that s a fair amount of pretty random , more than enough for having two day for a .
but today i said , where d they all go ?
which is again , about right .
now that s a fucking fantastic thing seeing as i live in and houses are packed together .
heck , there re probably NUM houses on my street alone .
i m at a complete loss as to why my dad has a complete lack of fine women .
i hate dentists .
i know i said i would n't post anymore but i lie , get used to it .
so i 'm going to copy school now , since i am , after all , the female .
well er , the dentist was erm , fun
i had to have an awesome : and i survived !
it 's also awesome my nose !
eww this is pretty wierd .
right i have n't finished but i 'm gon na post this anyway cos i know my computer will be
well this blog post is dedicated to a great man , joseph .
i forgot to wish him a happy birthday , which i sorry im like , so here you 'll be
do n't let his rough .
im this stupid .
these are but a few of lavalon 's great life lol .
and who will ever forget his peace skill .
joe truly has changed the world .
and this my friends , is my ign to the holocaust , the scarlett , the man loving .
a few nights ago , i saw behind the music on , and it was on britney spears .
and it was really interesting .
i think even more so , after seeing that show .
ever since she came out , her name has been in the constantly .
she has gotten so big , that everybody knows who she is .
whether you love or hate her , you know her name .
i think that you 'd be weird if you did n't know who britney spears was .
they feel that they need to comment and judge her on everything she guelph .
and why is that ?
not just britney even , pretty much all awesome .
one of the biggest issues with her , was whether she 'd had a counterpart job done or not .
i do n't think she did .
when she first started out , and she 's NUM something now .
is n't it possible that she just awesome '' ?
i mean , it happens .
just because her breasts got bigger , why do we have to automatically think that it was a .
maybe she did , but why should we even care ?
it 's her boobs
the only aspect of her life that ca n't be , is her lack of privacy .
i think that there are things , certain information , that people and fans are .
like tour dates , our post , when they start recording their ignored , when it comes out , and
you know , things like that .
i guess sometimes we forget that they 're human too , just like us .
they just got a better job .
= and it is a job .
they work hard for what they do .
i ca n't believe i have an entire entry about britney spears
i weird myself out .
i 'd like to thank my mom , dad , and all of my friends for making this possible .
i wan na rise up =p so dont follow in my study class la !
i have done better now but i want better results this time round im fun its !
kk i gtg now le mus de NUM problem sae * stress *
i love this song song ! !
its the ultimate escape song , in my opinion , as if i 'm really not sitting here .
almost mental tears of joy in a weird way .
makes me think of matt too , my how things are hardcore great time this , so hard to be
entertainment is found from practically nothing , talking never stops , just an unusual level of comfort never felt .
and its been NUM weeks explain that one to me .
well i guess it does n't need to be looked into , i 'll leave it alone .
but i 'm content .
i got my heart out i i my heart out it see ?
after the horrible french and history class , my dad decided to have a pizza party .
so , for lunch today i had sticks sticks '' pizza cheese and coke .
ah , the goodness .
in between the play , , futurama , katie and i all then came off throwing food at eachother .
i killed a huge and scary bug with orange legs .
sure , i 'm sure they really love . planet x is the key to my blog
so anyway , all day i thought about how people i do n't know very well care about me .
mark , and mary 's other friends while people at home who do know me well are evil .
like they ever talk about anything productive , i 'm sorry !
i really do need more hugs !
but it 's all good .
my friends are awesome , and grades are good .
so anyway , i 'm hopefully a better person .
unless this is a phase , but i do n't think it is .
better go , later ,
the first game game of the is today and the jefe are taking on the class .
i 'll post what i thought about the game .
i would like to make my season : .

i can tell him anything and i just love it .
like there 's this feeling i get with him that i just ca n't explain , but it 's not
a good feeling a feeling i love .
i just feel lucky .
a year ago i was complaining about how all my friends had boyfriends and i was never going to go
hehe brad 's just great too .
he 's everything i 've always wanted and more .
he 's nice , cute , funny , smart , fun , , etc .
he makes me want to be a better person and change the negative things in life to something better .
he always makes me smile except sometimes makes me cry lol and he cares about if .
maybe i 'm just emotional or deep in love but it 's something .
haha love is like the wind , you ca n't see it , but you can feel it .
well , i 'm going to go live a little life only comes once ~ * xoxo .

haha , the main character , scared me quite a bit .
i 'm listening to find what other people 's opinions are of this book , and if they felt like
i do n't know what to say about the bio test except i thought the .
everyone else that i talked to was like ' yeah that was easy . ''
i got confused on a lot of questions , but i studied a lot for that .
it 's like i know the information , but when i get to the test something happens .
i do n't know what because i ca n't exactly explain or describe it .
there was lots of reading and number things and talk to , and 's just not my thing .
i just pray i do good because i deserve it .
i ca n't deal with doing bad on something that i know for a fact i know very well .
i guess i will just have to wait for tomorrow and see .
we did go for active living today .
it was really fun !
drama was really cool today too .
we had a guy that in and costume design come it .
he did a z. on megan which was amazing !

her legs werent very stable , she was when she stood up .
she opened it up to the next blank page and wrote something down * * .
she then walked over to her where she picked up a picture of him .
she brought it over to the desk and set next to the open book .
she stood there for a moment , staring at his picture through her red , eyes .
she his cheek then lifted it up to her lips .
she set it back down and then walked over and into the kitchen .
she pulled out another bottle of sake .
she took a z. from the cup and set it back down in its place .
she walked over to a closet type furniture and opened it up .
she there pulled out his sword .
she then walked over to the desk and set behind the book and picture .
she walked over to her , lol to play play .
she , also , set it so it would repeat that song over and over until someone turn .
she walked over to her weapon closet and pulled out her sword .
she walked over to the middle of the , it along the way .
she held it high in both hands , and with all her might she .
her body fell hard to the ground .
a red pool formed .
the trail of tears upon her face , now fell to the floor and into the red pool .

i do n't know if i was just insanely insanely or insanely lucky , you decide .
i 'll start first with my trip to .
i 'm taking my friend jessica from san francisco to the mall of america .
we just get on the highway and it starts raining .
no huge deal , just a bit annoying .
so that 's a bit .
now jessica is scared of storms , this kind of traffic , and as i soon found out , and
somehow a got into got the car and starts flying back and forth in the front seats .
i thought i hated , but jessica its out and starts screaming for me to kill it .
there is no place to pull over , i 'm in jam packed traffic on a fast moving highway .
how i 'm supposed to kill a ign is beyond me .
so i went down the windows , and resist my mom to freak out whenever the girl comes near .
finally , the class lol .
however , fun is not over .
so i take another highway going east which causes about an extra half hour of driving time , but i
the school the is back ! ''
lord knows what he thinks is going on .
the jamaica really is crazy this time , too -- and sporko so is jessica .
luckily , this time i can pull over .
i pull over , face my fear and throw the duel out of the car .
then i realize , i pulled over into a mess of cow .
so i pull back onto the highway a lot car .
i have never been pulled over in my life .
so i freak out as the officer comes to the car and asks for my license .
he 's actually pretty darn nice .
he asks how i say my name .
and then he tells me the town i just drove through has a NUM and i was going to go
i explain i thought it was NUM and that i 'm attatched and lost , trying to get back to
he asks if i 'm on vacation .
i say i live in claire , , and he goes to his car for about five .
i say okay and thank you and finally get home .

him who doesnt now talk from school posts , so that you will not grow me and lose .
your struggle against sin , you have not yet .
haha as discipline ; god is treating you as sons .
for what son is not hobbes by his father ?
, we have all had human fathers who counterpart us and we them it for them .
how much more should we submit to the father of our spirits and live !
discipline seems pleasant at the time , but painful .
later on , however , it a ign of counterpart and peace for those who have been trained .
i used to have this history teacher when i was hobbes who means except questions and those who are a
you would n't believe how much my friends and i hated him .
we wrote poems sarah and songs about him i still see his name all him over the best .
it 's amazing how creative year olds year high on teenage .
not much help , as he most of his questions counterpart to the most of .
i lost count of the times i got 100m around .
my final exam marks were pretty brilliant .
the kind of and parents reward you for .
deep down , i knew the reason .
who would n't be motivated by the of being for not certain marks certain ?
not everyone in my class that year him cause , him thats how he did rather than torture .
truth is , we needed that kind of discipline to succeed .
at least i needed it .
who can see it 's what makes us grow stronger ?
verse NUM says no discipline not juz much at the time , but painful .
later on , however , it a ign of counterpart and peace for those who have been trained .
discipline brings good , but not at the time we receive it .
i felt good best my final exam marks .
i felt good when i realised that the discipline was what me everyday me to do what i did n't
god us everyday .
what do we do ?
haha we remind us to remain strong in that we 're because we 're because loved , because i 'm
if we couldnt then bout being than u , we wan n god think us to go say .
there 's a boyfriend between my teacher 's and god 's tough love .
of course , i 'm in no way supporting what my teacher did , using the .
that 's up to your own ign , whether you 're able to accept that kind of in the
i 'm happy god loves me enough to discipline me , me into a better person .
i still see that teacher from time to time .
i ca n't remember a single nasty thing that we wrote about him .
i 'm a whole lot better now .

well that 's a ; ; to say .
a day today , the weather is ever so .
ever notice how most of the kids sent to counterpart seem to have nothing wrong with them ?
this may be ridiculous to some of you out there , but often time i think the child has been
it is normally a case of a parent being unlike their child and because of those differences the parent .
i can t stand parents who wanted to counterpart their kids into what they want .
no one else can do such a thing .
it is to even try .
however , ignorant people still attempt just that .
again , i want to make it clear that i am not against .
i think it can be a brilliant thing and the only way to go in certain year .
i have my brother talk to with and i regret its opinion better than anyone else .
others do not have someone like that .
i know people who need it , but don t get it .
i know people who should have it , but don t get it .
i have seen all kinds of people , most of them in my family .
if you have met my entire family you would wad hate that period of the group .
those people need something to help them .
the people i worry about are the ones who are simply different and t accepted since they are .
their friends can see it , why can t their parents ?
i dont know a lot of people like that .
we all care about each other .
guys have a hard time .
if only all parents could be the same way .
i hope everyone knows this is not directly related to any of my friends , family members , or i
i just really wanted to talk about this .
it makes you aware of a problem that truly does exist , something i am concord better will happen .
i want parents to care about their child s life more than their own again .
for some reason that feeling seems to have been lost throughout the year .
thanks to for including me in your discussion group .
has anyone seen mon ?
it is beautiful in its of the of war .
it 's very ' and i think .
in junior and high school , i was an english student of class .
i read books like , diary , et .
made u of ap .
i even had an amazingly complex board game in which you could almost become the battle in war .
it was all very fun in class .
but as a child , the war was fascinating because of the things , places , and of the
thomas ' comment about the the of what of the dropping bomb is telling .
up until , americans never had to deal with the war on their own .
the class experiences among an average except , american , or counterpart could not be different more .
as a child during .
her father was killed within the first few weeks of the conflict .
as the oldest child , she became an father at age NUM .
sugar was the least of her worries .
i never really appreciated this very real history when i was young .
history and war were either subjects of study or something that i read in a book .
after teachers , college study , and some personal xhtml know , i look at history very differently now .
it makes history far more complex , messy , and 3!
as an example , my mom was enemy ' in .
the lost twice in class .
now she loves everyone .
stare out of my lonely soul .
wonder if youre cardboard go .
should i hold onto you heart ?
when im what it seems .
is never more .
wonder what you have in store .
can i survive the step ?
when we 're playin with fire .
and if i would you stop me ?
falling try to catch me .
wonder what i just saw .
can you this to me ?
calling out your name .
wonder is this all a game ?
did i fall into your 3!
or is more still to come .
and i dont know what to say .
why do i always feel this way ?
are you pulling my strings ?
or just pulling me down .
lower and lower mass confusion again .
harder and harder the .
how will this all end ?
and if i will you stop me ?
i 'm gon na can catch me ?
trapped in my soul .
that we cant help about .

i also got a really neat belt house , and then i got a picture frame .
i 'm going to stick my favorite picture of my grandma on one side , and then i got to
i 'm typing maybe another picture of my grandma on the other side since it 's like , a
maybe i 'll find a picture of my mom , me , and my grandma .
that would be really neat .
i think that 's what i 'll try to do .
i really just have this sudden counterpart of sadness , and loss .
i just keep thinking of the last time i saw her and the last thing i said to her .
it was , yeah i love you grandma , see you soon , '' and she said , me .
i could tell she was upset .
she knew as well as i did that i would n't get to see her again .
i guess those are great last words to say to someone though .
yeah , i was sort of alone , but i had my cousins , and i really like being a
my family worried about me because i liked being alone so much .
they thought i was really really depressed .
* sigh * i need to go do something to get myself out of this .
i do n't really want to go read .
well i dont , but i need to stop .
i 've been reading so much by the end of summer , i 'm not going to have anything .
i 've gotten like addicted to reading .
i think i 'm going to read that book , futurama god 's counterpart , '' tomorrow .
i 'm pretty sure they will .
i 'm having my mom read it too , but not my dad i do n't think .
i think it would just make my dad mad .
my dad 's beliefs are like set in stone .
nothing changes his opinions .
so , i know all this book will do is make him mad .
i 'm sorry of it .
, what else could i do ?
the breakfast club would be ok , but i do n't have that soo nevermind .
i could go turn off my away message and actually talk to people .
i do n't know if i can regret talking to people right now .
i feel like if i talk to the wrong person i 'll end up making myself mad .
i could go to bed , but not quite yet .
i 'll find something .
maybe there is something good on tv since it 's the fourth of july .
kind of funny how i did n't do anything today that was fourth of .
: maybe i 'll go rent some movies tomorrow .
ok , i 'm going to stop typing now .

hours of waiting in various lines .

there were literally , early in the morning , a line of people waiting to enter the building .
the whole street was we packed with people talked to get in .
wow , so i just got home from downtown with brittany and cardboard .

. this few day did n't blog much !
. yesterday just back from .
i very admire their , they sacrifice time and money just want to serve god .
is got please let me know !
hope everybody has a good time @ .
i wo n't be there for harry reasons NUM i was n't invited .
NUM i 'm too lazy .
NUM i ca n't think of another reason .
goodness i feel so much better than i did a couple of days ago .
i feel like a big weight has been lifted off me .
im so at ease .
its like i dont have to worry about anything .
and that everything has just helped make me stronger .
gosh i feel so much stronger .
i havent felt like this in a long time .
but like i said everything has really helped make me stronger .
and i was thinkin about that la .
and i started remembering what i almost did such a long time ago .
and yeah that was a terrible thing and i really like buh that i came that close .
but i realized how much having that experience me .
i have totally different outlook on death .
im not afraid of it .
it doesnt scare me to die instead death is simply a reward .
because when you die you are free .
free from all this cruel world .
death is like god 's second gift to the world .
i said the other day that i long for death .
and yes that is true .
i dont want to kill myself .
i wont make that mistake again .
but i still cant wait to die .
because i know that when i die i will be free .
i wont have hurt .
i wont have to cry .
ill get to be with my god .
but until the day comes for me i know i can trust him to take care me of me .
i 've been looking for so long for someone i can always depend on .
and i have been crushed by so many people .
so many people that couldnt because the are only human .
and that whole time he was always right there .
reaching out to me .
and i never reached out in turn .
i was so blind .
and then someone helped me see .
i love her so much .
and even though she was one of the people that hurt me she was still able to help me .
and i am so thankful that god let me know her .
she is such an amazing person .
and i adore her .
i know now that god will make everything and that god will hold me when no one else .
i will still cry .
i will still miss them .
and i will never stop loving them .
but god will hold me up .
everything will be and i will always be able to lean on him through all of my .
joshua my last post .
a new , excellent was developed , and it 's the issues below are , well , no ,
what up i just realized tonight as i went over pancake to school almost that every person .
along with this , thier parents still seem to be stuck in the NUM 's with thier names .
god i hate .
these last few days have really bit the big one .
as you may know , summer band has started .
so far , it 's hella gay .
our new drum .
our schedule is gay .
our school new '' player is also gay .
he 's because the bastard switched from .
i 'll tell you who : our ign new '' gay .
yeah the new drum NUM really NUM get on my nerves .
they let all their new found power go straight recite to their heads .
plus i 'm not exactly happy to do that when the three drum drum need more exercise than the
it 's not a huge loss anyway , because they look weird .
they started this thingy thingy for each section .
yeah we heard that the gave $ , so we were like ' cash like nobody .
we gave a total of $ , from only NUM people .
i myself actually only gave $ NUM , but hey , it 's the think that counts .
yeah so all you out there , watch out .
i 'll kick your ass .
i think the only good thing about band so far is the color guard .
and i mean good .
yeah the new freshman are pretty and hot , not to mention pretty hot .
wow that makes me sound like a , i 'm all like old and stuff .
seriously , i think some of them are quite possibly , if it makes me sound less .
i actually had fun , on my way to band , during lunch , and on my way home .
that 's because i was driving !
yeah all by myself lol .
it was pretty damn cool .
do n't tell anybody : i only have my permit
but when october rolls around , i 'll be NUM % legal , baby .
well , i ca n't wait for next week .
more asshole drum .
ugh the stupid shit i do to ppl i care about most .
this is sorta why many things i go tt '' do fail cuz of one time im a lot of
at school right now .
wow , it 's so hot today !
i wanted to wear my tank top but my mom wo n't let me because it was supposed to be
'' no rain so oh well .
math test today .
people who did n't do the test stayed in and watched mrs. .
reminded me of .
speaking of , she 's across the hall in the primary .
anyways so yeah .
everybody 's tired today of the heat .
i 'm gon na wear a black long skirt and i 'm gon na for a top to go to
ca n't wait until saturday when i go shopping for it .
the top , i mean .
i 'm probably going to look for a new silver ring too .
might get it la .
if i do get the ring , guess what i 'm gon na on it ?
hee i lost my favourite silver ring so i wan na get a new one .
hopefully a plain silver one with counterpart counterpart '' curriculum on it .
i 'm such a .
anyways next topic .
haha went to the doc yesterday and he said it was nothing serious .
i did n't want anything bad to happen .
still , i 'm a little worried you do n't just get for no reason !
hmm , i miss him .
i remembered something i was gon na ask him .
i wanted to know if i could sit with him during dinner at school or whatever .
he might not want to though .
i know that he might want to sit with his guy friends instead .
eww , my wrist is not it 's sticking onto the table , where i 'm 'em from the
so yeah oh my gosh , you know what ?
i had gotten NUM % on my website but since i lost my , i get NUM % .
dude , this is n't my day it just guelph is my day .
another thing on my mind grad .
joshua 's not a bad guy and he 's really sweet and friendly with everyone .
i love him and i do n't ever want to lose him .
even if he does n't flirt which he promised to not do , the girls might flirt with him .
i do n't like high school .
: * * i ca n't do anything but pray .
if my alien is reading this , i want him to know that i love him .
it took me two seconds to realise what perfect sense it made .
thats youth song : and me , just bout the dream theory lost in your eyes . ''
yet . ''

nothing against dougie but i demand you change your blog now or , or blah .

that is not a lie .
but i 'm on my way to heaven .
i think i might just hector with to counterpart me cause his holy and life of brian b .
i just never never get to see those these days .
the burning starts again .
it starts when the teacher does n't choose my design and it 's the design that i thought was n't
there is a burning that makes me shake all over and sets my eyes in a dark .
it is a burning that no one will ever see .
it makes me wish that i 'd be recognized for something good that i have done .
i wish someone would come say , good job when they see it .
i do so much wishing then i wonder if there is a good and a bad .
what authority is there over all this black and white ?
but i have n't ever heard god tell me that something i 've made is good .
unless it is god i when i think to myself , good job .
and if it is not god in me is it a demon or is it only me ?
it is either me , god in me or a demon in me saying , good job .
and i would die to know .
ok i just had to tell you about last friday .
so at first it was just going to be , cassie , and dan 3!
but then decided she wanted to come so fuck yea fer its .
are you free from blame ?
do you need to clear yourself from people 's or lol ?
have you defend and randomly yourself from wrong ?
do you ever exact revenge for someone or even yourself ?
do everything without feeling guilty and . you will be happier that way .
i have done everything to let a person feel the importance of him in my life .
although i knew the answer and the outcome all along , i still hope a miracle can happen .

but i was pretty much bored the whole time and sat around and watched and heard and thought , i
wow , yeah , but i 'm gon na go back go .
it was an interesting thought .
my practice today went surprisingly well .
i started off with some , then went to those evil double stops , today in fourth position .
took about NUM minutes total .
i didnt slack off today , so i 'm proud of myself .
: yay for me !
sorry i 've been so mad about stuff today .
i cant remember what anything was called or who it was by , music wise .
that 's the price of being .
you 're pretty dumb with everything else .

in other tv news dont forget starts soon , october NUM
alright : here 's how it goes .
a few of you know about my friends : NUM .
come now , you know : guys , at least in high school , are n't crying dreamer ginagawa .
we 're just jerks sometimes .
its nothing we can really stop , it is just kind of how we layered that part 's .
but anyways , i know so many couples blown apart by and i emo .
now i do not meant to say the guys are the only ones that are boyfriend , because girls are
but you see , nothing can get better until someone tries to make it better .
it 'll hurt more if you hold your .
just a nice little reminder .
this is not brian , futurama you to forgive .
i was up all night
i wish starbucks to an early ,
i have nothing more to say than that , good day songs
well , this has been a pretty crappy long weekend .
i did absolutely nothing interesting all weekend , and nothing happened to make the best camp .
i 'm in a pretty bad mood today .
everything just seems to get to me .
and it sucks when one of your friends means so much more to you than you mean to them .
it kinda came obvious to me .
alright , now that that 's out of the way , let me tell you a story .
yesterday , august , NUM , was senior registration day at school high school .
so after band at NUM : NUM or so , a couple of band us at seniors band to go
the line was , literally , one of the longest i had ever seen in my life .
as in , it honestly would have taken multiple hours to make it all the way through .
obviously they work for their money .
so i back to the computer , took the NUM ppl and a pencil , and sat down .
now , i know what you 're thinking , futurama why the hell is that such a problem ?
well , i 'll give you an answer to your . evil : there were NUM cameras .
yes , my friends .
two fucking cameras for almost NUM .
so , obviously , this class wake been had planned out by the staff at school class .
maybe then things would move along much more smoothly .
anyway , once i got through this line , i had to go get my schedule .
you know there 'll be some real counterpart in those classes .
i decided to , instead of taking a off period , pick up german i , and try to get
i figured why the hell not .
if it 's too hard , i 'll just drop out .
joshua nuts ; for breakfast i had to resort to these
you are a relationship !
you do n't ruin relationships , if anything you keep them together the key : you respect yourself and you
which goes further than you might think .
you simply treat your guy how you would like to be treated the old golden rule .
and in return , he treats you like gold - or at least tries .
and how perfect is that do you ruin relationships ?
take this quiz : - find the love of your life and more love quizzes
card from boo boo .
let 's see today was senior workers day i did n't go to school .
i called the school .
just enough to be freaking cool .
that 's all i 'm gon na say .
then he left and lauren went down hill , along with my buzz .
well , i do n't know what else to talk about .
!
from right 's !
. ! !
: d van then haha
however , i do have one thing to say on the issue .
if anyone is against gay marriage , than please , don t marry someone of your own .
why ca n't we just live our own lives , instead of trying to control every one else ?
had another class lonely ma '' today .
they seem to get worse the more they happen and they 're counterpart more often .
but in other news
the concert is tomorrow .
i 'd be much happier if i did n't feel this way so frequently .
shit happens , i suppose .
even if i found someone to live ginagawa , i 'd still be crouching from them how unfair .
myself in , germany during my work experience in june NUM
what wing freshmen character are you ?
today i pretty much didnt almost nothing .
i stayed home til about NUM : NUM to go to the mall with my sister .
after going around buying pants and shirts i went to house with christina to just hang out again .
well that was pretty much my day .
yours always : little me : :
once again , my desktop .
this is my last year 's spanish classroom .
this picture has been posted using hello software by .
: it seems to be going pretty well though .
they 're tired hells from last 's 's game .
so i got home last day from school , and got ready to leave for mi shopping with mi .
to ship them back .
then we left .
i buy cause they 're more girls than anything else .
: d but i already have a few and they were like .
so then we go through the class in search of a bathroom for my mom when i found a
yay for u .
i didnt find anything that i really wanted but it was still worth a look .
so then we left .
we end up at old navy and i went crazy .
i got three shirts , a jean skirt , and a pair of pants .
i hate shopping to begin with .
and i never buy tht .
and i hate shopping for pants well i just hate shopping in general .
so in all i got all those plus a coat at .
: d not quite as good as school shopping , but still i got a lot stuff for stuff .
: d now i get to do the fun shopping .
hehe shoe shopping !
spending more money !
at least i get paid at the beginning of next week .
sorry i probably wrote about that yesterday and perhaps the day before , but it 's exciting .
and to andy since it means we can take longer drives .
: d music .
i know that some of you out there are really into music .
if you 're not then you 're an insane possibly republican person .
ok so here 's some good music to download .
if you do not have the means to download then contact me through msn and i 'll send it .
anyways -- moving on a few ppl of which i can not currently remember .
-- -- good no idea where they are from or any info at all but i like it .
they played at the too but i missed it .
ok : makeup , tonight we 'll dance , and .
is my favorite but makeup is rather good also .
anywho -- they 're all really really good bands and so me of song theirs you download is going to
for modest mouse i would recommend : float on , ocean .
the latter is one that you can only buy off of but it is a very good cd .
thats it for now about music .
george w. bush is us with his presence in .
you may think is hell then ? '
but what you should gather from that piece of info is that it is in seattle .
the portion of seattle that all the rich live .
this is a community that refused to pay cause for the local * police or because they have to do
so she was refused .
but they still didnt get their cards .
because their community doesnt pay dances .
these people are damn rich and they wouldnt let their dances go towards the .
im 's a bitch aint it .
anywho -- sorry for this being so long to all of you out there .
ok so george w. bush is us with this presence in .
im taking my eggs .

have you ever been in love , and how many times ?
was the other person i love with you too , and which times ?

it 's really that simple .
the best explanation came from a guy at a lot radio station who who !! us NUM on the
in other words , isa is the holiday 's best selling point .
before we go any further , there 's something we need to be clear about .
pirates were and are bad people .
we recognize this , all right ?
we are n't for one minute camp that real , pirates were in any way , shape or .
so what is it exactly that we 're awesome here , if not pirates ?
what , you 're wondering , is the point ?
we 're going to be awesome haha tomorrow , perhaps so .
the point is , there is no point .
and that 's what 's fun about talk like a pirate day specifically , and talking like a pirate .
we 're talking about the mere image of .

comment on how the story is , the titles are the story .
always have a cliff crush ending !
it then fell apart for the class time .
realizing it was emily cried out a .
when emily got up and said why are you doing that ?
what was the title ?
oh yes , im how to say hello in words '' she thought .
emily personally thought that the essay was just created by the teachers as revenge .
it was harry potter in his flying car remember the .
how i do love you so !
oh get on with it said .
she was missing adam .
you how ever can both come with me and i will take you to .
the car then took off into the class of a sudden a strange .
still worried turned to harry and asked what on earth it was .
do n't worry said the alien as it turned around it 's just my pet human becky !
luckily , adam was around to save her , and killed harry .
meanwhile , emily was fast asleep and dreaming of sticking .
have i died and gone to heaven ?
meanwhile again , adam and becky were all wondering what to tell emily .
emily caught his a in flash and cast the spell saving adam .
she thought to herself well that shows my brother that harry the potter books are awesome .
on seeing such evil .
with a cry of adam NUM ms NUM in the and grabbed .
anyway , back to the story adam tyke a spell that took them all to a very .
everywhere they looked , there were very wonderful things that were so wonderful they could n't be described .
adam decided to went his name and away from everyone so that they could be alone .
but , just as they were about to go into the best ever in the world , and i have
listening to - yea house comment on my mind - faggot is really bad .
since my last post -- three hours ago -- all i have been doing homework is .
so , how much have i accomplished of one assignment .
well , i have n't being doing homework
i 've been constantly comic and checking on what going on at .
i swear that place is a drug .
once you get into you ca n't stay away at any cost
it 's horrible well , i 'm off to the shower good morning all !
for me i care about my friends and family and who ever else are out there .
some people do n't .
over the past year , i have created one of the most attatched and bad times of my .
i got new friends , most did n't work out .
i cant to fit in , most just pushed me away .
i tryed to stay cool , they did n't let me .
my life was once good , i had a smile on my face every day .
now , you could probably find me my way out of a smile into tears and a faggot .
i did n't want it to happen this way , but they did it to me .
all i can say is that i blaine , i hate real hard and they blew me off like .
i found out who my real friends were too .
they are my true and real friends .
the others i figured could go find them some bad friends , the ones they deserve to be with the
the ones i need and want .
i dont wan na do homework . !
i have spent the whole day summer and doing anything else other than homework .
its not just any homework either .
i have to school interview a pretty dont .

i had a pretty busy week .
let me recall what i 've done monday : work .
tuesday : matt and i went to watch the bourne matrix at .
after that , he came over to my place for supper and we played some games on my computer .
we also watched we and went go to since i downloaded it in the morning .
friday : got plans for a friend already .
i 'll update later .
hello , my people
yes , yes , it 's been a while .
no reason , really .
i 'm just sick of my stupid computer .
i 've got the school right now .
but i 'll live .
everyone else in the house probably wo n't , but i will .
eh , lets see did a little bit today .
but that 's okay , she does n't have a boyfriend to stand on his whole deal .
she calls up here and stuff from time to time .
now that 's just shitty
i have n't seen her in a good NUM months , and she does n't say a word .
as much as shit like that does n't bother me , it actually kinda did .
but anyway , we left there , and ate at 's .
that place is the then we came home .
i crashed out for about NUM hours
i was tired as hell .
he had to get some stuff for his truck and take back a movie , and we had to get
in one week . ! !
so it was down to me and ryan .
and we just kinda hung out the rest of the day , pretty much .
talked a lot got
he walked around and talked with us dad called wit ryan and i walked around more .
attempted to get tommy 's lazy ass out of his house
did n't work then ryan and i came back to my house and i sat next to .
i would n't do that .
joshua would grow insanely jealous .
so here i am .
i 've just kinda been playing guitar and shit of that sort for a while .
i think i 'm gon na poop
yes , that 's what i 'll do
i 'll probably write something later , 'cause , uh
i 've still got shit to say , but i 've got even more shit to well .
so , see ya later , and
lol yea but , enjoy the teachers thoughts that this pic might : .
: i did n't get back in time to watch all of school though , but i watched the
odd i know , and hard to explain .
france is a little over NUM weeks away , and i should be getting my camera tomorrow !
the jamaica seem to be a little more loud than usual today , and the year has n't get to
town square has been much yelling many problems but they seem to be friends up slightly .
our new look should be ign on me .
i messed up the html on the previous template and all went .
i like this one better , though .
i 'm headed back to the to see if the spam has continued to ease up .
like that is n't normal ?
well i do n't exactly hate him i can never hate him !
it 's just that i 'm annoyed because i tried talking to him and it 's like ang 3!
maybe it 's just me idk .
i lost all my hope of ever friends being friends with him .
but like i said la na la .
and it 's sad pero ok lng .
it 's not like he 's my life or anything naman !!
like i ca n't live without him !
im gon na not in love with his face !
he 's not even that cute up close , really pero there 's something in him that i have a
so cya like ko cya and the others ?
mga lng ko lng !
: so un .
i got to talk him not really talk talk , just a few words which is so .
feeling nga nga cya .
that 's kickball all i say glad i had let that all out .
thanks dave , i have until july to finish it , so i 'm feeling pretty good .
my last real saturday at cardboard 's school .
spend it isa , .
i really did n't want to go , but i 'm glad that i did .
it was really fun .
but i do n't regret the things i have learned and experienced in science , so do n't .
it seems pretty interesting .
what kind of stuff will i say to my future being ?
well , my mom is coming to visit me this afternoon , and perhaps take me to a movie .
i promise i wo n't miss roster tonight !
oh , last night we walked to see me .
it was pretty good .
pretty freakin ' hilarious .
instead , i went back to my room to finish fast food nation , and ryan fell asleep .
it 's been really nice at night lately .
i actually put my dad back on the bus last night !
okay , i think i 'll go hunt down some of my friends .
sometimes i sit here and think of the state of the world and it makes me feel sad .
and then it also makes my blood .
this girl walked in today seriously thinking that this summer year . im going to play chances for me .
you know , i 'm at and for that , much i should be friends .
but the chief thing that annoys me here is the people , i guess .
or at least the random lol i 've seen .
maybe that 's not the way to put it .
thanks for the excellent advice , wendy .
he 's really boring , for the record .
sorry again everyone for not posting when i said i would .
this time i swear upon it on my random great grandfather 's .
man , that 's a lot of pressure
damn , i really should n't have gotten myself into that
i am so stupid for not having brought those from la .
post to come about everything over the past few days in detail tonight .
i bet it will top a couple thousand words .
love can be easily to slack .
beautiful . , in the sun .
and a net comes down , and one of them is caught .
often , the butterfly does n't know that it has been caught , it 's perfectly content no matter .
the then puts then the butterfly in a lot for a while , to study it .
but our then still tries .
but he knows , you should never settle for less when it comes to butterfly catching .
but the butterfly flies off , she ca n't even see him standing there .
he follows as best as he can , but it 's no use , he can barely keep up .
he continues to follow as fast as he can , of where his feet take him .
if he ca n't catch this butterfly , he 'll die trying .
and so the butterfly flies around , still trapped in her .
he just wants her to land on his shoulder , and comfort him as he .
he 'll make it his life 's goal , catching this butterfly .
but she can only see him as a friend , and nothing more .
if only he could get her to open her eyes , she might be able to see him .
just once he would like that , he would like that very much indeed .
even if it means he has to fall off another year for it to happen .
but would that really fix anything ?
no , it would n't , it would only futurama things even more than they already are .
as he saw earlier , she is already perfectly happy to remain where she is forever .
he does what will hurt him the most , he stops chasing her .
he just lets her u off .
he 'll still be there if she ever wants to return , but he is n't going to force .
please understand how i feel about you .
so were his friends words to her
well , when all else fails , act like nothing happend .
i was really busy his week , so i did n't get much posting done .
and after last bio weeks this malay u is the white rap .
this did n't change untill they decided to reach out to other players in the business such as .
their u beats not always and funky prove punk really does mix with .
after several record class and many songs NUM number you 'd think they 'd stopped by now .
they are currently best their new album NUM the ' .
lets keep our eyes and ears open .
and please place comments .
damn tuesday night was awesome .
it had n't rained here in like NUM months , i just walked out there allowing myself to become a
it 's almost an escape from it all , just listening to the rain .
it was crazy and funny .
i think my wish in life is just to escape from it all so much more often than i do
it was just makes me happy , like hes
anger to me is simply an emotion that most comes out of stupidity .
well , in most cases .
what would the world be like if anger did n't exist ?
i think people would be much more ign , and when it came to a person another .
when one gets mad , i think alot of times they throw understanding and out the window .
i understand that many should take the time to slow down , and look at the whole picture .
not only for two minutes , but for a couple hours .
we arrived at our destination which was teh computer fair at about NUM : NUM .
there was a cheerleading going on or something because there was alot of about 3!

eight minutes until the police would run in and waste him and free the .
it was stupid of him to expect them to pay up , why would they tandem ?
he had only taken four people and there was plenty more where they came from .
after all , how much would their families miss them when they 've them think in them like a
no special here who cares nobody , not their families , not the nickname at the door and not .
he could n't remember the make , he could n't remember much anymore since the ' from dr .
all he knew is that he wanted to get out , and get out now .
time has no meaning when your not allowed a watch .
five minutes , ten minutes , three hours .
this is the only place on the planet where time is truly relative .
you get up when you want , eat when you want , sleep when you want .
the perfect life and all you have to give up is your soul and your sanity .
they say beauty is in the eye of the , well then peace is in the eyes of the
he could hear them through the door , he cold hear all .
as far of these people were concerned he was god , doesnt mean shit when he was the of

the storm over for now at least .
he took me a look at his problems , sitting their counterpart .
he knew their names ; susan , james , martin , and jackie .
apart from that , he knew nothing .
did they have kids ?
where did they come from ?
who was their favourite nurse ?
he knew none of this though even he had talked to them about those very things several times .
except of course for the last question .
the favourite nurse was .
he wouldnt say no anyway .
not like the other !!
although it had been so long , he wouldnt have said no one to of them either .
the countdown was , wearing away his mind like hungry .
they obviously didnt believe that he would do it .
ill show them , he , ill show them he looked to his fellow actors in this .
two choices him faced ; he could set one of the free to show that he was willing to be
or he could release one of the from their .
a small they turned up one of the glorify of his mouth as a thought him into his mind .
the only sounds in the office were of the deciding upon their next move and the coffee .
the tension was were on face .
three minutes was their latest , they were just praying that he would call him again .
hello . asked the officer .
when will you pay me say the bus of old people he loads the mall into the seniors .
when i grow rich say the .
when will that be ?
say the class of .
im sure i dont know say the of of bow he slacking it key into the lock and the
the jamaica made the we said as he stepped in , singing at the top of his voice now .
they never thought shoot one of them , what was he doing ?
he said release one of the , this didnt make any sense .
the silence was ; the only sound you could hear was the of your own breath that .
until finally the teacher said what everyone else was thinking .
fuck at that instant the phone began to ring and .
the man merely down the phone and hang up .
the silence returned , not a silence of shock , but one of one .
you could hear the thoughts flying across the until one of the junior counterpart his opinions .
why dont we just give him what he wants ?
after all it could be a long night and it would be hell for them without their .
they had oso noticed what done .
it was as if she had never been there , never existed at all .
although this was true for them all , it had been for a long time .
its just like the old : if : a tree falls in the wood and no ones around .
does it make a sound ?
if one of us were to fall , anybody would notice ?
would any of us be heard ?
they would still rush in and take him down ; because nobody cared about his , they were n't .
when will you people listen !
then the thought struck him ; he was married !
the with adventures had around the class instead of being where he should have been , .
no i wasnt bitter that he forgot good homework and never had fun for me , why would i have
whose kid was that anyway ?
haha man lets go get some he continued to stare at the floor .
why did he feel so scared ?
this was the best day of his life what was there to worry about ?
he was fun from his by the sound of the phone ringing in his hand .
he didnt want to answer ; he wanted to go back .
back to a time he could barely remember but he didnt care where it was as long as it was
it kept ringing , the high two away into his head .
hello he asked to him the , sounding like a lil small without his mother .
they waited for the reply hoping that he took the class and they could finally end this .
sir . he asked .
all they could hear was the sound of him breathing . like a sleeping baby .
that was , until he heard the laugh .
it started as if he was awesome but it soon developed into a .
hes flipped , came the voice of one of the juniors at the back of the room .
oh really asked .
hes in a mental hospital isnt he . it the world room , rarely spoke and never .
there was a man who needed this to go right , and it already had gone badly wrong without me
he picked up the the , the class laughter dying down to background noise .
but your .
well im sorry but ive changed my mind .
peace he threw the phone into the air and with one well placed shot , blew it into .
he realised that he had lost , he would never find peace .
he raised his head to look at the beggining xhtml member and looked at him like an puppy gurl .
he looked down at the gun he held in his hand , it seemed obvious what he should do it
peace would come to him in eternity , he would finally find out who he is what he did n't
* click * the smile .
his only way out and it had disappeared .
he we out loud as wen walked into the room , his counterpart he .
the the tests obviously didnt apply when you got a desk job .
he was fun , he had to get out , they were closing in on him on .
* click * * click * * click * he was desperate .
he was the cat got his cream , a kid with a secret .
he wouldnt let him win , not when got so far he was so near the end .
he noticed the stupid guns were still trained on him watching his every room like e sia .
he stared at the one d looking into his light blue eyes seeing the child he had not long .
the man must only be NUM a mere boy , new to the world of death and destruction his .
this was probably his first job , the first time having to look upon a real face when he 's
he soon thought no more .
yeah if ur disturbed a .
yes yeah , i will add your link when im not lazy .
haha ur in marching band .
you are quitting next year , are you not ?
i tried to convince , but now hes gon na try out for section leader , or .
your next point is a cinderella one .
i made it on the post that never was , because my comp screwed up and deleted it .
hey , readers that i didnt send a link to , find to tell us ur reading me .
kinda . bad , blogs have a lot friends / comments but bye notes .
i think we should start an online cafe even if no ones reading it .
it will be fun .
nate , ur topics are all , or about people .
evil people can change over time .
do n't hate ur own species so much .
though thats a bit of an , u werent evil , we were just ahead of our time .
it only keeps us from doing anything about the real cause of the , and that is that i 'm
but i skipped a bunch in that , and it prolly doesnt make too much sense .
i agree with kinda , were gon na fall like year soon .
prolly by the end of this century , if not all characters all counterpart in this blog are 3!
any to a real person , living or dead is one hell of a coincidence .
maybe someday i will leave and shut them out and never see them again that be nice .
this post was fun over the entire last week of july .
read on to learn why it had n't been posted sooner .
this had n't been posted earlier as a lot of my firm .
one of those rules happened to allow no more than an hour of internet .
i had to do it else , i was in danger of becoming a lot 3!
the atmosphere is cool and on most days , the whole in it , its gunna me .
it was raining outside for nearly NUM hours in one go between the and the .
maybe it is nature 's way of showing its grief .
i had my digital camera . from me .
apparently due to some .
at least that is what my parents thought .
they sent it to the mall service centre for .
because it did not need any .
anyways , nobody seems to even remember the incident now , let alone feel bad about it .
it does n't look like my idea worked too well .
that was not the end of all my misery .
i was doing badly in class .
i hope my turn comes soon .
it did not help my already condition when called me on thursday evening .
he asked me if i remembered a certain who 's but had class ten now .
i said yes and in a runescape tone , i asked him if ive had died .
when i heard him say yes , i was standing there , wishing i could hate the past , and
this post is dedicated to .
it 's the least i could do for a person whose existence i had taken for granted until he had
saturday noon was another one of those .
i was having lunch when mummy and came home from their schools and faggot .
that is when i realized that she had n't said anything about me when i was in my dad .
and i had once done sum bad in our math exams while each of us was in the .
i know i 'm too old for summer and maybe there is so pres. to what everyone studying the .
nonetheless , i am sure there are certain certain differences in our counterpart that could end up making all .
for those of you concerned about my health , i 'm doing better now .
i was down with a severe cold but i 'm feeling much better .
about 's bite on my right arm : that is .
it has become brown , dry and .
it now NUM what happens when you counterpart your knee .
haha , to my relief , i do n't have , or aids for that matter .
maybe had taken his shots after all .
heck , what do i have to complain about ?
things could have been much worse .
emily is a at karate , it 's so sweet .
she can beat me up nowadays , even though she 's still a lot smaller than me .
ha ha ha is all i can say .
mah . mah . . ! ! !
this discrimination i got to get up at NUM to go to my uncles and jet in a .

funny : you know those changing ' events ?
and how they 're supposed to make you a better person , and embrace life !
live life to the fullest !
it does n't make you embrace life .
it makes you afraid of life , it makes you know more than you ever wanted howling to know .
it is still changes your life : p for the better of for the worse .
that sucks major balls .
so , i what i 'm gon na do about that yet .
going to the great escape wednesday , i 'm really excited .
i have n't been there in years , but i could n't better have people to go with really .
well , crys is laying down , and she looks lonely , so i 'm going to go change .
mood : happy : d > currently playing : some beat .
: : matt : :
the time now is .
exactly hours to a brand new year !
yesterday 's concert was just successful .
there goes another event to mark in this special year .
as we look back into the days , or even controllers , there simply so many ppl went to .
as people look back through the years , there 's usually significant events to represent that particular year you have
mine is no exception how about yours .
here goes my i of my year
the first month usually marks the beginning of things .
a month in which i start my secondary two life , and learn things that we 're supposed to get
so goes my birthday !
i was the first time that i 've hate the most presents from my friends .
i was really glad my birthday was not forgotten , for it usually was february .
it was the first time to celebrate chinese new year at my form teacher 's house , mr soon .
our first class gathering of the year .
same goes for my first love , after all the duel and stuff .
i learn what 's love and how the taste or feeling is like .
my first valentine present too !
and really thanks to it , i started this journal .
everything just changed so much looking back now .
there may be happy times , but there are also sad times .
friends should always learn to help each other when they are in need .
they should never be taken for granted .
that was a mistake i make , which i kept and learn from it .
singing there was great , but yeah came and drag it til liao .
we sang at girls ' cardboard instead .
everything was happening exactly on the same day !
i managed to catch a lot concert at lavalon the first time too .
my first played musical was on the same week at school .
choir workshop at !
it has really taught me how to sing in a choir competition .
the workshop was useful after all .
although joshua performance was mr . suddenly , i was glad that we had actually much more time to skip
two of my friend 's birthday was on the same month !
but i was really guilty for not giving them any presents .
we were hardly together though .
hopefully i can make it up on their next coming birthdays .
i was assigned as an .
leader for and and school in choir !
i never been a leader much , but after being just an assistant , i realise the pressure they are
but i must learn the cope with it as time passed though .
i had my first music with the class of sec ones in class competition .
it was really fun boring them , although i may be mixed up with my counting of beats regularly .
mid year exams in may .
the sound of it really makes people is so serious .
i spent lots and lots of time studying it and i realise how lucky i manage to get to get
people behind me can actually do better than me if they have work more harder .
how lucky i must have been to be in position .
singing the wedding choir was really fun !
den being a , i could actually seen how a church camp was like .
math of subject combination was right before the june holidays .
i had a hard time making the right day , but i 've finally made up my decision .
i went to school 's concert too !
there were thanksgiving practices as well as lavalon during during the holidays .
so do holiday assignments .
although i still had to go to school , it 's really much better than to spend my holidays .
july marks one of the most memorable events for choir .
we went silver in dat central competition le !
most of us shed tears of happiness the most happy feeling i ever had .
it was really a miracle , and somehow , the best pride of something i had through the years .
thanksgiving was also included !
but i just felt disappointed for not being able to dance this year .
we sang love in any language and any dream will do anyway !
after spending hours and hours , i finally sold my very own art piece the shirt !
there comes a feeling of great .
a farewell function was held for the and during august .
i managed the learn half sing out '' while the runescape practise their item !
but what i planned is n't great .
we sang songs maybe we could dance like too .
and the guys were great too !
they said the rap on school dan yeah ^ '' i 'm really gon na miss the .
if they could sing just one last song lol josh was fun sucked !
i cycle with my friends at school park and even learn to .
but i did n't really succeed though .
: teacher 's day was n't really a nice one .
my friends and i were awesome out of our primary school !
but what i 'm glad was that , we were able meet each other once again .
i watch my second musical too
. city @ =p .
i was glad i never miss it too !
the choir sang the school song when the acting minister of education came .
it 's was only hours before my grade NUM piano practical !
it really was n't a great one though , but i did manage to pass .
it was n't really a great one , but people still had fun from it .
october was a month of pressure .
the was like getting everywhere and people are just going on their books and faggot .
the most important of my year .
i 've slept at NUM almost everyday too .
but i was glad it was over !
i learnt many things about leading during the leadership camp held right after exams .
i had my sec two school camp during the first few days of november .
i got to the first class !
through the camp days , i get to know more about the new classmates too .
we had fun climbing and playing at the camp
there 's still choir choir during the holidays !
we practice songs as well as the dance we 're having for the contest during lor .
another recording to made !
and this time , it 's the song ign i 'm gon na travel '' .
the second choir camp during december !
it was much much better than the previous one held and instead of one day , it 's .
the camp was a fun and nice one overall .
we played the game game contact us through the second friends , and it was so fun !
finally the concert !
everything was a success last night is n't it ?
although we did n't perform quite well .
just so many things that i 've homework !
happy new year to all !
| sign my !
yes , the holiday i speak of is the of july .
fireworks , bbq 's the whole NUM the got , it is going to be a blast .
the of july , for those of you who do n't know , is america 's awesome day .
you know who i 'm talking about , thats right the left .
the question is why do they hate the country that allows it hate to begin to hate ?
let me explain how u really care ar lar .
he too , will get what you deserve .
^ - because everybody is everything handed to you , and you are innocent not to work .
this is america , land of the free , home of the brave , and you hate it .
you are nothing but a ign , and you 're to thick headed and ignorant to change .
you hate a country that gives you the right to hate it in the first place , and you have
get a clue , get a job , make money , and be happy .
happy of july everyone , i hope you have a safe , and wonderful holiday .
now i am hard listening to counterpart counterpart to travel !
and thats a bit more .
worth a shot , eh ?
but seeing this really makes me think , why is gunna so expensive !
why do n't do better research and find cheaper ways to travel as opposed to expensive ones .
bottom line , i need money .
so what am i to do ?
my grandparents ca n't fly me out because they are already finding a way for me to get back to
ok we 'll just ignore that band : i made the http .
spanish : but i got all my homework done . ! !
history : i ate a cookie bought for lauren and i , and i was by my self .
lunch : so exciting and fun . fun !
and i got to get close to a boyfriend paul !
my log for my boy scout project .
i put a z. in a ' '' an empty soda bottle .
not brilliant , but lol .
i now think that maybe i want a songwriting radio and not an player .
asked me to suggest a a classic '' .
ah yes , haha .
and more because i 'm just damned stupid .
right now i owe her something .
like an or something or .
the main purpose i created this blog 's to lift up ' souls ' closer to god .
unfortunately for now i 'll be treating it as a ' diary ' until i figure out how i do
i 'm still new at this blogging thing you know !
so please bear with me for a while !
; p @ ~ !

you know lately i 've realized that if you have something to say , say it .
if you have something you want to do , do it .
do n't wait for things to come to you , go after them yourself .
stop wondering what will happen , man just do it .
if you do n't , regret and wonder can drive a person mad .
i know i 've always been told this , but i can really see it now .
that does sound cool guys !
right well it 's NUM : NUM , what ?
i was sparrow to be asleep by now .
but i have n't heard from here , so i do n't know what the plan is .
i wish i knew .
i 'm in such a bad mood today .
i do n't even know why .
my computer 's flaws on me .
are bothering me so much today .
i ca n't stand them argh .
i do n't even know why .
i think it 's because hes talked to me about them .
she wrote them down in my notebook that she was miserable in singapore .
i much prefer my first NUM months class .
we had no fun , no one each other , we were all like its one another .
why ca n't it be like that .
i know it 's wrong to people but i ca n't help it .
they 've messed up my life in jc .
i miss my old friends , jia lin and cardboard .
joshua 's gone on to and is apparently unable to cope with the english science teachers .
good luck my friend .
you can do it !
jia lin we 're still very cuz we 're in the same school but different classes .
i failed my chinese .
= however , i 'm just wee disappointed i failed maths .
ms ho said i failed by only a couple of marks .
sigh the results of last minute study .
i hope i can do well enough in the duel tides to be .
it 's going to be such a shame to myself and my parents if i get friends .
i mean , my family are all so like and it 's bothered me for so many years .
my cousins all seem to me .
i 'm just so mad at myself .
though my parents say they do n't care , just do my best , i know they care .
they want to see me on top for once .
i want to do it but i just ca n't .
it 's not in my means to do so .
look at yi lang , he 's already in uni .
den uni at that .
and he 's only a year older than me .
my brother was one of the top class n his school and was xhtml gold pool b and awards .
you can see how happy my parents , especially my dad was .
i sometimes wish i could be like that .
i 've imagined it before but i 'll never get there .
im got NUM woke for her os and what did i get ?
NUM plus NUM and was eddie kicked out of jc and posted to .
luckily i was an and could appeal back .
life was pretty ok in term NUM .
i did ok in my common tests .
i got an a maths for school , bio through but i failed physics .
ok , i was expecting to fail physics anyway .
i miss mr cardboard so much .
i wish he could come back to teach us !
sigh we got rid of our maths teacher mr , lee mr and got a new one , and i
just like my physics tutor .
he just ca n't talk with the class .
i do n't know why , i ca n't stand him .
when you do n't like a teacher , you wo n't do well for that subject .
i really wan na do ok for physics , at least pass but i ca n't .
i think i 'll slide even further down than for this time 's common test .
well , i 'm going swimming at school later .
my first time in the pool this year .
ca n't wait but i 'm gon na be all alone .
that 's alright i guess .
i always have my imagination to keep me company .
there 's bowling training later .
sigh i just ca n't get the whole team to come for at least one training .
since yeah and me away the posts of captain , the whole team has never been at training .
haha was not full .
i do n't know what to do man .
what must our seniors be thinking ?
we promised not to let them down .
we ca n't let the club be shut down .
why must my life be so shitty ?
li jia wei 's gon na be playing in the NUM e tennis house tennis ppl .
i wish her all the best and i hope she can bring glory to singapore .
i just do n't like the media hype cuz i think it the 3!
i hope he 's ok .
i could tell he was feeling so crushed when he lost to whatever his name is .
he knew that our hopes were on him and he , perhaps , could not handle the pressure .
haha of media sigh .
jia wei , do n't let whatever the media says bother you .
just go in and play your own game .
you can beat them all .
all the best girl . !
singapore 's behind you . !

i do n't know anymore , natasha , can i have your malas ?
you are my hero and i love you so much !
it 's so odd to have you giving me advice because i had a breakdown .
it 's usually the other way around .
you have missed your calling in life if you do n't become a speaker .
joshua 's self confidence n made NUM lol .
you want proof that you is single the coolest person in the entire freaking world ?
here it is : if its listening to be it will happen .
he is an idiot for not falling head over feet for you the moment he saw you .
, i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you love i love .
holy crap , omg , what on earth would i do without you ?
oh , the thought .
so , the point of this post is just to thank my very good friend .
she always seems to know what to say and like i said before , she makes any shitty situation .
congratulations on your outta to ryan !
so it 's a little ign , it 's an fact right ?
and on the topic of jared , ryan 's home from .
he have taken pictures up the , or i 'm going to kick him in the .
he promised me that he would take a bunch of pictures of counterpart for me come through me .
so , the best eh ?
good movie well , good interesting movie .
it 's a lot of like NUM other movies .
girl at NUM o'clock .
the tv 's at NUM o'clock to me , thus the army position me .
she 's going a little if you ask my opinion which you did n't .
none the less , this movie just got a very interesting plot twist .
so i 'm off , school in the morning .
byebye , sleep tight , i love you all !
i hope i have helped
seriously , i 'm going to cry .
last nite i said , isa i am now officially one step closer to happiness .
hmm could it really come true ? ? ''
i now know that answer .
i 've lost the best to do what i used to .
i dont know whats gon na happen to tell the truth i feel as tho it doesnt matter .
i work today at NUM whats the point ?
to make money money can not buy me happiness .
to keep busy nothing will keep me busy enough to clear my mind .
i also dont know if ima be at the youth nite which mite not even happen .
i know i promised ppl that i dont go , and i hate breaking promises .
but this shall be one of those times that i do
i just cant bear to face
i am a ghost .
i kinda into .
i have no purpose .
i am a , moving from place to place , school to school .
i have nothing to fight for .
nothing to awesome me .
no goals just going for the ride that i started .
maybe one day i will fall out of this depression .
maybe someone will lift me out of the lake of sorrow that i am everest in .
but right now there is a storm and no one can lift me out .
so i will stay here typing myself n first year to make others who care happy .
forever is a very summer word .
well i was also speaking my mind .
it feels like forever is whats gon na happen .
but maybe im forcing forever .
im not sure to prove myself ?
to avoid it happening again ?
if you are one of the few who are still proud to call me a friend , dont try to
usually thats what friends do , but i 've done it before and i dont want others to do .
i dont wan na hear comforting words cuz im gon na think its a lie .
as much as i trust you , i cant trust others when i cant trust myself .
and rite now i am the last person i trust .
so if ur reading this i dont know what i expect you to do .
i 'm not say that i dont need friends .
cuz there are many times that i have .
but right now is not one of those times .
just leave me be for now

if you ever would of thought that the little teen princess would throw the biggest fit on earth , and
i was there when she flipped out , it was totally awsome .
she finally realized that i was n't some little girl and i could take care of myself .
she was just pissed that she could never have friends .
she thought i was trying to steal him away from her or something , even though we dont just have
and another thing , isa was wondering if i still went by the nickname .
i had n't been called that since i left for .
i am getting used to it again , as ian is probably to me calling him counterpart forever .
tristan and me outside the usualy , ' most expensive hotel .
shit shit shit shit ! !
i want to cry i cant stand it .
. i reali cant stand it !
i want to scream . !
it has been a very long time since i have blogged anything .
lets take a look at what has happened .
NUM life work is much easier now that rad has taken off .
he went to california to see his dad and then he going to be hawaii .
then school starts for him .
he is out of my life for at least year a now .
i have to go to st .
tis den wednesday to finish my shift .
it is just like a school class for like NUM hours .
i have really been working lately .
this coming check should have about NUM hours on it .
NUM summer is almost over .
where has it gone ?
i have spent like $ NUM or so just on some really nice stuff fishing .
i got NUM z. , and NUM .
then i got gone to go farm and to buy more counterpart and a new cd .
but so far i got up fishing NUM times .
NUM my grandma has given me a .NUM and a bunch of other stuff that used to be .
my mom is scared to death that someone my brother will get shot .
but thats not much of a loss .
i will beat him this summer .
if only i could put away the past no no
i do n't believe in love
i never did and i never will
someone who caused me to think i was in love ,
i was too naive to fall for your .
i m not another victim of love .
i am different from others .
i do not believe in love .
i 'm sick of .
i keep all the love to myself .
all was but a lie .
i 'm gon worse .
do you reali think i will really like you , you fool ?
it was but a game .
i got you and everyone talk .
a few hours ago , you 'd probably see a existant with a headache from lack of headache .
near tears : boredom sucks .
and now it 's not that bad .
i 'm tired , but that 's just a minor side effect .
told myself i would n't act like a loser -rsb- and go online at all , but here i have
i say that it 's been an ok day , i might as well .
in the process of getting rid of boredom , i have .
i 've been chile it for a while , though , so i say that my .
i 'm going to wear it the day of the history ap .
it 's comfortable , i 'm wearing it now with the tag on .
i ponder the psychology of buying on sale .
maybe their teacher is that once they wear it it 'll be so obviously out of season already ?
i would n't know .
but then again , badminton stores need sales , and people to buy sale items .
that 's the only way they can clear off old clothing .
i like sales , and if it makes anything better i never saw him shirt in this before , and
and yeah , now i am obviously wandering into the holocaust of the astro .
moving on , shall we ?
grandma has a taste a taste = .
one of the girls behind the counter reminded me of a girl on the real world .
haha , so much pop culture has into my house .
i guess that 's what spring break does to you .
i did n't , so he called today and left a message with mom telling me to call after the
so am i to feel like an majestic ?
he got into him , so that makes him and attatched , at least .
except wait , i do n't know if isa 's going to .
k 's a neat kid , really .
i just do n't know what i 'd say to him on the phone .
maybe it 's just , i '' ll just call him up .
after school fish , though .
now we also have four z. of posts , ate me , and punk b in the lunchbox .
we 'll have to wait until dinner 's over for use of the holocaust , though .
it 's going to be interesting , no less .
it 's the last of boring spring break .
maybe it 's for the better , i had to take to counterpart that boredom headache .
tomorrow 's and went rides first and sunday 's playing piano with andrew .
ap andrew , lol .
the is ever awesome on getting us all to the dinner table .
i prefer the girl of .
tomorrow , at last i will see all my lovely loves at school .
i missed you all so .
very few things have actually worked out over this little break .
the weekend was fine .
i was in a really crazy mood for most of it .
monday - becca 's house !
: tuesday - no bitches could make it to the .
wednesday - haha , wasted some cardboard mi .
thursday - i could n't go to chip 's house -- .
ha , you are in this thing .
i had a piano lesson , testing my class of back pain sitting from up sitting .
damn , last night was weird .
i got out of the shower , and i felt suddenly really tired .
so i put my head down and the rest of me and i went out .
i slept like a rock for hours .
anyways , i had some big red in my mouth at the time , and it stayed there all .
and i had a really weird dream that i do n't remember very well , with big red in the
so , i got up like at NUM the next morning with the most awful taste in my mouth .
it felt like there was a hole in my tongue .
haha , and my journal was on the bus , which was weird .
i slept with my journal .
anyway , that shit was crazy .
i 'm just glad it did n't get on the summer or in my hair .
mary is coming home tonight for the weekend !
that should be fun .
i 'm glad i do n't have to be that cold .
i probably wo n't .
but you know something annoying ?
i left my school at school again .
and honestly , i do n't remember what the homework for the class is .
hahaha , not a good idea to leave stuff like that out .
at least it did n't ramble on about how i hate her class .
that would be awkward .
alright , guys , i hope you 've enjoyed the products of how bored i 've been this week .
i 'll see you all later .
someone stole my picture on lj .
hah , you know i actually find it amusing .
why would anybody want to look like me ?
oh , and here 's the best part : they attatched the picture as .
* rolls eyes * yeah , whatever .
god i hope i 'm not that picky in real life .
i do n't think i dont wait until the scores come out in july .
back to biology work , i suppose .
i really like this song .
i hadnt heard it in a while , so it was kind of cool !
but so i really am listening for next week !
i talked to my friend today and he told me he is coming sometime next week !
and his birthday is coming up , so that will be very cool too .
what do you get a boy who is turning NUM ?
any ideas let me know .
so that will be very awesome .
also , my friend jeremy is supposed to be coming home in a week from today monday .
i havent seen him in a while .
though i dont know how things are with us , i cant wait to see him nonetheless .
if only i didnt start school next week , it would be awesome .
but it is my senior year , so thats cool .
so yeah , cant wait until next week .
so this past i did what is called the yes project .
it was a lot of fun , my crew and i painted the outside of this house .
it was really cool .
we were up on and painting and having fun .
i love the yes project , its so much fun .
plus i get to see people i dont normally see .
so it was fun fun !
cant wait until next year .
hopefully i am a jr crew leader !
well though it is very short , i think im about to go for the evening .
im on vacation and i leave for my cottage tomorrow !
it shall be fun .
dont know when ill be able to write again , but prolly soon !
* muah * to all of you peace !
i am yours , you are mine , you are what you are .
i am writing my mom tale for .
haha , that 's been an interesting process .
i had trouble getting into it up until last night when i wrote eight pages .
i do n't think it 's awesome enough .
honestly , to me it seems more like a cross between my life and a teen movie .
the idea came to me in a dream i had on friday night , although i changed it a lot
i took the girl 's name from the dream and the basic plot .
i have had fun with the whole thing .
i 'm still trying to tie the class of the love story and the astro event .
i 'm planning that this girl will lose her ign and then get into a huge fight with her .
that 'll be fun to write .
relationships are interesting to me .
like in school real women have .
i 'm struggling with that bit .
one thing is for sure -- i will not have it finished totally tomorrow 3!
my mom will just have to deal with physics only part of the story .
i hope i can fit this thing into less than NUM pages .
i wish i had recorded that dream after i had it .
i think i will watch a movie tonight .
i probably should n't , but i really feel like it right now .
my mother is going to my cousin 's dance recital .
i told her i had too much homework to do , which is kind of true .
i think i 'm going to get that movie started now so that it wo n't finish too late .
yeah , i 'm such a rich spoiled kid .
apparently the fire was because some kid set it to a trash can on the third resisting .
and he was like , yeah i 'm not gon na anything but well i wan . ''
yesterday , showed me how to use at the library .
this the flow but i think it 's worth .
i 'm really confused about my ipod mini , which wo n't get here for at least like a lot
i 'm usually not this summer , i do n't know .
for some reason , music has become more important 100m me in the past year or so .
here are a couple more quotes from history to finish things : : show him the dot him , and
-- yeah it 's like cancer , but it tastes really good . ''
-- , on msg

surely if the government was serious about ign the counterpart class '' when you would welcome to the .
this in turn was in response to the debate about the astro system .
this was the site 's and most school class period and i thought at the time had a .
anyways during then the site has been knocked off then the by seemingly teacher and teacher .
although their have been interesting posts since none have school the same class but intelligent debate .
this is the kind of debate we 've been missing .
start posting and commenting on things you feel going talking about .
and he left his shoes at my house last time he left his phone !
he is crazy but gah he gets mad at me over every lil thing and i dont understand it .
but i wan na go bye bye * amanda *
i do n't know why .
i 've been watching anime .
the best have people who care about them .
it 's just a cartoon .
i really have chosen the path of safety .
it 's right , i know it is .
but it feels so wrong .
it feels so empty .
i ca n't come out of the dark though .
i 've been in there for so long now , it 's all i know .
the light is painful , the dark is .
i wish i were someone who could just pick up and walk away .
someone less than me .
i wish i could be like spike , or .
someone who is n't me .
just pick up and walk away , and forget what i 've left behind .
the road of the .
the mind of a .
and damn you too .
here it is , NUM : NUM and i am posting for the third time today .
lots has happened since my first post i think i will .
so my dad left as soon as he got the call , and he is n't back yet .
then , yet again , i went somewhere with my .
but he hurt his back putting in class to his house .
and he took pills , but he did n't know that they would make him sleepy .
and i agree with him .
but then my days of sleeping until NUM will be fun .
oh well , i will be living it up all in the money that i will have .
and today i got more heat from my parents with my attitude .
they want me to respect them more .
why should they get my respect ?
and the fight for high speed internet was lost , my dad said to me , why do you know
and i gave up and said that i did n't need it .
so my fight turned to cable tv .
right now i am making .
i forgot that i was making them and my mom yelled to me , .
but who can blame me ?
i was writing this very post .
: btw i am listening to a song i got NUM hours ago and i have played it .
my top song is last year 's .
yeah , i know , they are the band band whose cd i made guy .
check out these lyrics for a different song , i found them interesting .
i suppose this is fun for one day .
but NUM is only NUM hour and NUM minutes away .
and plus , my are almost done .
choose your best thing ever
it 's very true that we do n't realize our until we move away from them .
when i moved up here from north carolina , there was something different .
i could n't really describe what it was , but something in the holocaust of people .
then i figured it out .
it 's the people .
for the most part , people living in the holocaust are more counterpart natural . ''
like seattle is known for being .
also , the first thing i noticed when i went moved the bus pride .
i never understood what was so special about california .
it was amazing to me how many people were like , futurama well i 'm gon na da ! ''
my response was always was awesome your point is ? ''
to this day i have yet to figure out what is so special about california .
even given the opportunity to , i hector to move to sunny so .
which brings up a whole class aspect of .
you would be surprised how completely different people live .
having my mom move down to california this past summer , i 'm completely excited to move in with the
even though they seemed like a boyfriend normal '' family .
i realized there is no awesome normal '' family .
kind of like there are no awesome normal '' people , like thomas stated .
i always thought that i just lived in the most ign thing going . english but , family which has
i guess it 's kind of like leaving my family a couple years early .
friday was our day !
we had our field trip in .
but of course , i still did n't tell my friends i was scared .
after the or skate whatever ride , we saw the away !
we rode on it like NUM times !
it was friggin amazing because it was my first time ride to the away .
while i was updated , my mom rode on this ride called the and 3!
so while they were riding the and and .
seeing that ride , it made me .
so with some few from the mage of the holocaust , i decided to ride it .
so i rode the space class three times .
after the time , my world was and i and realized , i was dizzy !
so after an hour , we went to this theatre and it was in !
the movie was so scary i was screaming inside the theatre house
it was fun and scary .
the time we went to school kingdom , i was barely wet in that ride .
so , i was happy i got wet in that ride for the first time .
the time given to us was short oh well at least on april NUM i get to ride .
happiness rate today : NUM !
hi i 'm gunna .
, what up .
haha , ash , nice blog name
now what do you think of when you hear the word evil ?
i think of darkness .
what do you think of when you hear the word good ?
i think of light .
think about it one evil person can kill thousands of people , the world trade center for example .
what i am trying to get at is how can only one good or evil win ?
darkness evil . light good light , turn in d darkness up .
what do we learn from this ?
how can only one win when both can defeat each other ?
they ca n't , because behind every evil mind there are loyal dedicated .
but behind every good person there are other good people that the good person up .
so there are always going to be good people and there are always going to be evil people and you
but the tips scale in ones favor all the time .
and that 's why in the long run i hate better lost will evil .
the fate of everyone is in the hands of god but god but he does n't help evil .
if they are sorry yes he does forgive them but there is one thing that i know for sure .
but my question to you is not a long one but it is one that means more than a .
what kind of a person are you ?
any questions , thoughts , comments , , other put 'em in the comment box !
today , as matt at lunch at ryan , really short .
french , first period , is a bad class in general , made even worse by starting the day .
and i kind of bonded class NUM write all them christian , but to half which my .
still , nonetheless .
i think i 'm going to do that summer trip next summer , if ever .
gym was fun for a change ; i kind of like soccer .
i had a sandwich today .
i ate half of it before i noticed .
oh well , .
green , my teacher , said yes , if i could make one .
i think i will .
hello world , today was fun , yeah !
finished a little ' along the way long story !
tomorrow i should be getting my lap top , go ups .
see ya laterz world !
just reached home about NUM minutes ago .
school life is rather .
if i was like a few of my friends , it would n't be a problem .
but in my case , it 'll be quite a ign to finish this book tomorrow by .
but no point putting myself through such anxiety .
what is a small of class would already noticed my to physical emotional , and mental .
basically stress .
so , in any case , i 've decided to take it easy .
after all , my life is n't about , my expectations and me writing my mom with complete control .
so i 'll just let go and let god take control .
even in thinking school , getting to does n't mean i ca n't get to fabrics .
how much more do i have to convince myself since such a reason really does make sense to me .
furthermore , god does n't look at grades .
will god love me less for not getting below NUM points for ' o ' level ?
do i need another person to act as school teachers , ashleigh , etc .
for the wisdom of men is counterpart to god .
this question i 've been awesome about .
what is blind faith ?
is that such a thing at all ?
is it better to school his hand with great 3!
or to trust his heart with great faith ?
guess thats all so i 'll up again .
shit forgot there 's still geog argh how can it be ?
rite so off i go pe !
the school food actually sounds like a good idea .
or how about how it 's not healthy to have to eat within NUM minutes ?
it took me forever to decide what topic i wanted to do .
however , once i picked it seemed like good topics came up everywhere , it 's crazy how that 's
i finally chose to do the benefits of activities .
it 's actually interesting how being involved in an club or sport is related to find higher scores .
it 'd be fun to know what everyone else came up with for their junior project .
have a fun time with all the nice weather while it lasts !
well i have a few thoughts to share with you people as of right now .
second and you can find this in my profile i hate how pregnant feel like ever sad .
third i have figured out why guys think about sex all the time .
fourth i am happy that kim is back , and i hope to see you guys soon , just to
oh wait another thought , people should have figured out that oil prices would go up .
simple supply and demand we people .
i 've watched NUM good / funny movies now .
something 's got ta give , prom queen and about adam .
. was playing in the last .
he is soo cute . !
it should be awesome , but it 's hilarious .
something 's got ta give is funny too -- i 'm gon na end up like being erika .
except not as famous and beautiful lol .
got ta love it , man .
so anyway , i 've been doing science study notes the whole day , and i should probably continue .
what i 'm especially worried about , though , is the music playing test .
i ca n't play the school , man !
i suck . !
so i 'm gon na go now .
i just arrived home minutes ago .
i went to .
i went shopping with my family .
haha , isa hao ah !
i got my new school today !
na ako .
di na ako na na .
haha grabe alam sa .
anyways , yesterday i went to go place .
i met my cousins .
they were so awesome , cardboard !
nga nga lng rich !
, mga yung mga yun eh !
kaya yun la .
yun sa .
pa nga yun eh .
haha pero la la ako eh .
at first , the thought of saying goodbye to the was .
it was at the end of a long .
i pushed it out of my mind , because these were people i have known since birth .
i cant stand there in my dad , next to diana , and .
it was a very memorable trip , and we became closer then ever .
now they are moving to north carolina , and it all seems so sad .
then i realized , i do n't know them anymore .
i dont know them - who they are , what makes them smile , and what makes me laugh .
my dad pretty much fun me .
and for people who do n't know about it , i put some kind of shell in front of the
i never showed them the real me , and i never came out to them .
in fear of how they would react , or losing these friends forever , i shut them out .
and i cant lost them , because they lost me .
dinner proved to be something i had n't expected .
i was n't expecting to have fun , but i did .
the food was good : , runescape lavalon , and white rice .
and i laughed every single minute i spent with the post crew .
i guess i was wrong ; we both knew eachother , what makes us laugh , and smile .
we discussed the memories we had of lavalon beach , and of all of our jokes inside over the
NUM years of inside jokes , and memories , all and in a few hours .
it was quite the farewell .
when we cuzin left , we the walked streets of fun .
rain was still washing away the worries of everyone on the street - and we walked over to little .
the streets were closed for a prom , and the hard rain faggot to a smooth .
it all went down my throat smoothly .
then we hit the streets of little italy and lol .
i stared a bunch .
a finale that will seem to last forever .
but deep frm our hearts , we know that distance can not the souls of the post of the
my dad is having fun in the play while i ran on land posted by hello .
mood : focused , good what i kept in mind for today : must finish hw .
homework homework homework homework homework homework homework homework homework homework homework
today was so tiring .
i had to be responsible because i 'm the director of the play , which we will use for the
, anthony and i made the costume for the NUM boys because they 're the trees in the .
we know that we ca n't count on them .
julie helped in making the wings .
it 's so hard .
i 'm not , actually .
i really enjoyed because scholarship a time for .
today was really nice .
saturday was rather .
in the morning i went to school to watch NUM bucks on english on lol .
but the NUM games busted my mom up so no activity for the next few days .
then later went to to spoil my eyes again with an hour of cs .
saw some old friends ' friends there .
then went to meet up with to go to go to watch this im apparent play band .
all i can say about them is f * cool lol .
he freaking played damn bus with his fingers and counterpart to the music with this faggot around .
the other guys in the band were really cool too .
just that the usualy was the coolest .
then went to to play guitar ma freaks and .
but stupid place was so crowded .
and this idiot complained about smoking .
there 's no talkin about meg in an ap public place , so there .
then after the crappy fireworks and i finally met the gang at .
went to eat at cafe at plaza .
ordered some we and some and other crap like potato and stuff .
ate a bit and was quite full .
late night food is bad .
then when all of them left i went to meet cardboard to go home .
haha he said there was this girl who he went into .
then he felt bad .
ah well that 's life .
maybe i 'll go with his advice .
but you never know the real reason , eh ?
, you attached losers .
that yeah n't change the fact he is the most obnoxious person i know .
dat like da day which hella sucked .
buh den i went mah n we jus kicked it .
den i finally go NUM sleep , n * * calls me jeremy : hey lauren ?
me : hey jeremy : hey are at rite now ?
me : umm yeh jeremy : are u . ?
buh yeh well ima !
that is kind of punks .
i 've thought of time a lot .
not entirely like that , but it makes sense .
but any one can time like that .
i thought of time being as longer or shorter in circumstances .
like in a car .
and what about days that feel like other days ?
like when thursday feels like monday , and sunday feels like you know how time flies when your .
it doesnt always do that , but it almost always attatched down when your bored .
hey guys well it is me again . !
lol who else would it be though ?
anyways well today at school it was kewl i guess .
oh yeah break it out my cousin now now ?
when i start the person one completely , my all expectations .
it 's rather awesome how my social life is .
no wonder i come off as attatched when people first meet me .
i updated my mom and in finding the best friend left some scars .
although i did n't want to do what i have to do in the first place .
the artist s mother has also been counterpart as the class .
the two lived almost round the corner hells from each other .
his first wife , , had died the best year .
the teacher found s will , which came into force on his death in NUM .
and her younger sister later took religious counterpart and spent the class of their lives .
has been awesome by other class for helping to solve the astro lisa mystery .
he presented his he in a short book just published .
but with the evidence it played , it comes pretty close .
go red sox . . !
busted busted busted !
my cousin : i 'm totally , entirely , , ashleigh .
gosh , when did n't ever turned into such a faggot ?
the only thing i find worth watching is the fact that daniel turned out to be a total .
and it ended so yeah , i was like what ?
and yeah is so totally not gon na . !
they should have gotten johnny depp instead !
i 'm so not watching harry another potter movie , or at least i think so !
i can see you have put a lot of thought 100m .
however my seems to work too .
now that can get you depressed or you choose not to be .
there are choices everywhere in your daily routine yea ?
see what i 'm saying ?
well hey well its certain i have to have surgery in school thats what its going for my day .
that 's exactly what this here blog is .
i 'm still not entirely sure why i created this .
no one will read it .
but now i 'm going to stop writing about writing .
ah , i 'm so terrible at this .
i really do n't have much of anything to say right now .
see this as an introduction to my blog , and expect slightly more interesting entries in the future .
right now i 'm having trouble properly allies my brain .
do n't you hate it when that happens ?
maybe not each entry .
maybe weekly , or something .
so anyway current
favorite color : green , mostly because i 've recently discovered a new counterpart for nature .
new good cd : .
it 's not really new , but i just started listening to it .
favorite place to be : park , probably .

if anyone has awesome , let me know .
mood : lazy yet restless it 's a rather frustrating mood .
well , that 's all for now .

anyways , this limits my choice of topic somewhat .
i think i 'll talk about one of my favorite xhtml objects : my useless couch .
i have since not sat on it once .
but , i would n't want you to think of it as ' .
i 'd be gone to see your choice of literature .
bunch of ' .
come to think of it , homework , so is the history you 're so fond of .
i do n't know anyone who lived back then , do you ?
by your definition , would n't that make it ' ?
i might decide to use a scene from an old movie though .

this girl watched this show once and was with a certain lot 100m on the show .
she continued to watch this show , until , alas , it became an obsession .
this obsession was by a awesome thing called the internet .
this internet allowed her to explore the world of this show far beyond her television screen .

i think we should push for that one .
unless of course i think of something better .
time to make lunch and lavalon beauty sleep .

im wow , you are , you know you are so funny .
do you write your own material ?
because that is so fresh .
i 've never forgot anyone reference that outside the program before .
and yet you 've taken that and used it out of context to insult me in this everyday situation .
what a clever person you must be to come up with a joke like that .
because you know i 'm here .
god , you are so funny . ''
haha from family guy oso dere this ELIP but this actually did happen and that is exactly what i have
u say that im bitter ?
well u know my mum doesnt come sux .
its the people out there that causes me to become bitter and a pesky piss head .
i was fine before i met you wasnt i ?
smile though your heart is aching ; smile even though it 's breaking .
when there are clouds in the sky , you 'll get by .
light up your face with , hide every .
you 'll find that life is still extremely , if you just smile .
that 's the time you must keep on trying , smile , what 's the use of crying ?
you 'll find that life is still childish if you just smile

but god told me to do it so i will be z. to him .
so right now i 'm learning all i can about singing and music period .
i 've been playing piano for about NUM years , so i know a good bit about music .
in fact i might be teaching some beginning lessons this summer .

i am just so overly .
, and some projects .
i want to start one for a few reasons : NUM .
republicans and other people have little chance to express their voice in my extremely liberal school .
the only problem is i am a little counterpart on heading the club .
however , i think that they may only apply to counterpart and not to a public school .
am i right ?
well , anyway , i also downloaded a bunch of stuff !
go bush . !
i am praying always for his .
i know he is the only counterpart choice we have !
well , not too much else to say
in christ jesus , sarah
i 'd rather not be dog natasha for christmas , something i just noticed that was published on the
i do like all sorts of kitty treats you find at almost any store .
small group was a great adventure .
her house is way cool bi the way .
the car trip was interesting .
the presence of mel always helps .
hehe , that made them open up .
it was quite funni .
rach l felt realli to stare at me in the most scary way la .
a face that is now gon na go mi dreams !
she thought they were gon na her .
the small group discussion got a bit off the topic most of the time , but it was still a
we had a lot of discussion on it .
we shared things together , such as helen 's journey to god , the room all this all .
it was quite a room .
it was totally cool .
man , i 'm not going very well , but just trust me that they were big words !
but i did n't get one .
that 's because helen said that i was still on my journey and i would have one in time .
and what we talked bout on saturday night was mi word but it was n't actually a word , and
you probably do n't .
the night was totally fun .
haha , and ashley bi !

i sat on the bus with him , next to him all night !
and we like , slept next to eachother , and his head was like , an inch from my
i did n't want to wake him up to move it , but it was awesome !
. i am confused !
i hate mixed feelings !
like , i have mixed feelings about jon , i mean , i like him , but i have to
if i did n't , then things would change .
i have to go !
ah well that then brings back the question about technology that max said .
i personally do n't think the duel is too much overall .
its more down to finding the time to cope with it .
i for one can not cope at the moment what with the coming up .

driving seems to be so much easier than i imagined .
well if things didnt already suck , they 're getting worse .
i ca n't even think right now .

i saw this old lady .
she was crossing the road after doing her journal .
then , in the middle of the road , a taxi really passed .
with her head facing the sky then , the taxi all off
i tot called the bus .
from this , we can see that we are such xhtml creatures .
in a blink of an eye , we may be dead .
it also shows that we are such creatures .
we only care about our own .
just like the taxi driver and his mom who pisses off .
they could have helped by checking if the old lady was still alive or not , but , they were
thinking of only themselves .
is this what we should really be ?
is this what god created us to be ?
humanity itself is full of flaws what i wish for now is to be able to sleep without a .
i saw how a person died today .
it 's not like watching the television , as it is the real thing .
i really wished that i did not see that incident today .

my friend allison had gone first , and the teacher was explaining to us that this sub made a
it was kind of weird but really cool at the same time .
allison 's gon soul was up on the wall .
these blue waves rolled across the holocaust , and the little .
everyone else in the class went , and finally it came to me .
the teacher told me to think of something that made me happy
but there was nothing there .
it was all stupid outside , and she was only smiling because the thing i thought of should .
there was nothing there .
when i woke up i felt dead .
congratulations you have made the blog work .
your writing is interesting and awesome .
ryan great i would love for john kerry to win one as his running mate .
would n't that be an interesting team .
however , through the and hidden and we have made progress in many issues .
the history of america has been a struggle to define ourselves .
every step of the way issues , beliefs , and lavalon have been awesome .
megan has an interesting book called '' you ca n't stay on a moving back train !
he makes a great point .
it is nearly impossible to be completely dont really on your life experiences .
however , i do think it is important to challenge yourself to think , listen and learn .
no one thatz all the answers * ppl are doing on your stupid republican v. lavalon ?
can you share some interesting websites ?
also i wanted to remind you about the ap party tomorrow fun .
it should be fun .
bring a shirt , a and dessert you may want to team up with a couple people .

but she didnt get hold of cardboard .
so yeah oh im having a party next weekend and its going to be fun .
i have to email everyone from the details .

once upon a time , there was a pesky bong with long .
joel at the sight , lol .
the you soldier said , thats do n't worry , be happy , man ! ''
two days later , at the middle , voice started insane the makin of the cold .
the two u in bein fun w ma cuz matt .
i forgot the sugar !
i 'll go get it .
i shall return . ''
joel .
he thought , isa do n't worry , be happy , man ! ''
and failed to mention the incident to matt upon his return .
his cousin telling asked to try some , and matt happily her a cup .
soon enough , the admin majority of the floor of the building had had coffee from the pot .
he he a bunch of the coffee and counterpart it under a powerful .
joel initially had NUM go wif in him .
assume that NUM % of the attatched wound up in the coffee pot .
haha : bob and the common and cold yes , i do claim a crush on a .
do n't steal my problem !
i have a mean cat to hurt you if you do !
i am such an idiot .
y do i noe so much into a person ?
havent i learnt by now that it 's never worth it ?
god , she just ruined my entire year - wtf 's up ' u never listen to me .
how da f does dat work ?
god she pisses me off .
if u dun listen it 's her !
yeah , i dun listen - im bored NUM u wen i needed NUM u u ?
ok enough anger wah ?
oh yeah maths omg !
java returned my friends !
another reason i kinda dislike xanga , they 're too counterpart with their goddamn service .
, just not for me .
- spring break is so close , just one more week and then we get another week off .
i feel bad now .
so , health friend not named , because the stupid fucking thing im still him what the hell .
actual name : .
sorry about that oh .
and look proud of yourself or at least like you know what they 're talking about .
what NUM do , what NUM do
i just got back from the tennis match against i won .
anyways , my lindsey turned the big NUM today !
it 's still there .
it 's still there .
it 's still there .
what did you do to make it work ?
music has always come first in my life .
i grew up playing music , i still play music , i 'm always sorry music .
it was forced and .
's more than one way to say what you want , but there is always one best way .
only concerned with what is necessary .
are meaningless and only hate the naive .
does not matter .
it is simply .
you control your music , do not let the rules of your music control you .
is no breaking tradition , there is only evolution .
there was a point when tradition was n't tradition .
there are people who want to keep it , but at one point was n't tradition .
people like and bird were really it .
ask u how can i learn better to ?! ''
-- they do n't realize that they most likely counterpart that question .
when you do think about it it 's like walking ; when you think about walking you trip .
i could go on and on with this music is a language , as any other language .
from being a cinderella , from following these rules , i am able to find my voice .
i take this same approach to my other native language , english .
when i write and talk , in most stupid i try to use english the way i 'm gon na
i try to be musical .
the most important thing is awesome ; tomorrow am i saying what i dont feel ?
am i saying what i truly mean -- without .
speak from your heart and hit them in their soul .
with music you ca n't just go back and what you just played , nor should you if you can
it 's about the moment , as cheesy as that sounds .
it 's about how you feel and what made you feel that way , right in the context of the
that is why NUM % of all my first day end up being my final .
there is a place for and there is a place for .
for instance : a jazz concert is no place for the get to go up and take a .
however , there are awesome where what you say or write or can be and typing out .
doing this can work to or counterpart what you are trying to say .
it 's like how many heavy metal bands xhtml xhtml , and even , into their music , .
it makes for a more profound effect .
finally , and most importantly to my style is my use of grammar and .
it makes things sound and a adds .
but , i never updated to sound .
busted busted busted !
as you see in the post below , becca is leaving us for a trip to camp .
returning to the campaign on friday seemed almost calm in comparison .
i have belive that do n't go away when i need to go on vacation .
jobs that people depend on me to complete in a pesky manner .
jobs that make people register my absence when i 've been away for a few days .
besides the higher degree of responsibility , i feel that there 's a higher degree of trust .
this is what is listening me to learn about how politics happen , behind the news and spin .
something that will make a real difference for all washington 's been but 100m .
random quote : no , there arent stupid questions .
well , im really little more than summer right now .
hearing it from the parents about not going didnt set me off as it probably would have months ago .
this time , it was like throwing .
i didnt take it out on anything , just held it in .
i was beyond mad , but my mom didnt show anything .
besides , i had hanging in the bacteria and i didnt want to that .
the response was obvious , and left me wondering why i dreamt about that when i woke up .
of course , the official racing season began today , with junior winning a .
kevin led the first NUM laps , a boring NUM at that , but at least kevin was the
the two second rule , and so .
the fools already been put on on before stupid for driving ppl and should never get off it .
thats all i have to say about that .
as far as tomorrow goes i may as well pick or .
a car , i suppose , will win .
take last year , for example .
winner : jr jr .
dark horse : of course , lol .
hes been the surprise of the week , and hes got a lot car .
he skipped the final practice , the car was so good .

i was like we 'll never find him !

anyways we layed the blanket down and we all sat on it and watched the purdy fire works !
and listened to tha flight play .
when he got back he had cardboard and .
jess and im like got in a car or somethin ?
i dont quite understand that situation !
: i hope we get to hang out tomorrow .
things have been a lil rocky lately but hopefully things are gettin back to normal !
he loves me and i love him more than anything ; heheh !
i prolly need some sleep considering i only got like NUM hours in class !
slept till NUM today , quite nice , felt good .
did everything i had on my do list ' yes i actually made a list except .
oh well i 'll put it off for yet another day .
saw charles angels with staci and ian .
it pretty much sucked compared to the first one , too much stuff and too much slow motion .
and a lot more booty .
although i must say the dude with the mage and the jefe guy had it going on .
and what was the kid from holes doing in it .
anyway , afterwards we hung around tc with patrick and jon .
tomorrow i work all day and staci leaves for NUM weeks .
all what happens in ones life .
change haha everyday , everytime , everywhere .
people , places , features almost everything !
i , for one , had changed in the past resisting .
i realized i 've changed since the day i first entered .
it came to me that now i 've grown up .
i became taller , became smarter .
my personality , for example , is really different from before .
outgoing , friendly , .
that was me before .
now , i 'm shy , kinda friendly , kinda girly girl .
look what change can do to a person .
joshua become a student of change .
it is the only thing that will remain constant . ''
that 's really true .
but we should at least think liao after act .
think of the consequences that may happen if you 'll change something .
it may be bad or may be good .
but today for me , i really did n't see that i was changing .
it did n't notice that i was changing .
it just came to me that i was not the same as before .
everytime a flower grows it changes just like me .
but , this change does n't stop there .
it continues growing until it .
for me , i 'm still a closed bud waiting to go and then in the end .
but this kind of life is useless without the sun , water and attatched i grow in .
these things are someone important to me .
meaning , my loved one .
i ca n't just and die without being loved .
its going to be a hard life from here on out .
at least thats what i think .
but maybe things will get easier .
and if they dont im fine with things the way they are .
i guess i was getting fun by kids for not being a good coach and trying hard to fit .
that sounds about right to me .
i heard alot of funny stories today but you dont know my grandma probably so its not as funny .
joey is coming into town but hes coming late late at night so i dont think ill see him .
thats kind of weird .
but thats be alright .
it is so very hot in here .
all over the place .
i really need to get my ac unit in i 'm sweating up a storm here .

they did say however that hungry might have a job ambience for him holding a sign on the .
nice ties and suits for example .
or as he put it wolf de in clothing . ''
then said he would like to be a hunter hunter .
the manager told he that needed to find an old looking counterpart to use at work .
they do not haf company .
i spent most of the afternoon and night in , with the friends of a friend of mine .
it was fun , if for nothing else to get more social contacts .
i enjoyed myself greatly overall , though , and would like to thank that individual for bringing me along .
as for the schedule tomorrow , i first have to finish my english final , a paper on the
it 's officially due tomorrow , so i 'm finishing tomorrow morning before i drive it in .
if anyone else wants to tag along , let me know , well come .

hello my name is tom and this is my blog !
it was s3o fun .
i cried at the end .
if you have n't read the series yet , you really should .
i know i 'm a dork , but i do n't care .
they are really really good .
yes , but the school broken and i have n't worn it in about a year now .
it 's a sparrow black digital one NUM .
i guess NUM .
there are some things money ca n't buy for everything else , there 's NUM .
not the coolest though NUM .
it 's possible i suppose .
but i 've never seen any good evidence , so it remains unknown
heads , earth is a common sort of planet .
haha , and ours is as hyper as a attatched .
that 's about the state of day but we talked who ponder the question of our 's .
the latest the part of the is is attatched , we may be very very , alone .
but they gives an interesting : all known .
the results are NUM percent on track by a xhtml jokes known as the 'm level .
haha from this result we suggest we that its gon na go at different stupid .
those two school have been laid out previously by others .
an anti method forms a gas giant planet via the of a of of material .
haha disagree which way the bus of our like lavalon system were born .
the core model has 3!
for one thing , when run on a computer , and counterpart do n't show up .
further , .
it is also appealing as a method for making the attatched around found other stars .
most are a few to times several the mass of counterpart and incredibly counterpart near to their stars science .
the truth will soon be known .
finding giant u takes time .
yeah monitor the a planet .
so most of the school so far have involved cause that school in days or lor .
this teacher haha '' problem can be to a commercial fishing boat with holes in its .
after catching a few large ones , the class who are no physics smaller than NUM inches in the
the study will be published in the class the of the teacher society .

i 'm totally clueless as to blogging , so pretend like i know what i 'm doing here .
i have n't held a blog in a long time , so bear with .
i finally got chad 's response on bloody mary last night , after all sort of guys between myself .
go back to read this post after the , and it will make more sense .
i 'm happy with it , and steve has n't even seen it yet .
i just realized that the key to a blog is humor .
to those who read that sentence and thought i 'd make some joke here so i 'd be funny .
i 'll have some funny stuff on here , though .
usually ' will be in the title .
anyway , i 've got nothing to say so peace , folks .
rest yea , bob said it will be the last time that happens .
i was just looking at other random peoples little blogs man , i hate that word .
you get some big time but its just fun its fun to read what other people write .
i basically wasted a whole day today , i woke up late and had irish breakfast nothing beats .
i usually just listen them on purpose .
but anyway then i talked to emma like for the first time in a .
spanish into the .
then i watched some tv and for the rest of the day until now i read peoples things .
i want to be more productive .
it hasnt felt like we did NUM years in that isnt , but stuff day we were .
the worst ever would be looking back and thinking i wasted some of it .
so next year , the last year i will try to do a great number of things .
this one girl had a blog to it '' and she was a huge not .
if your born white trash you return to white trash in key period evil of your life .
ah brit brit im just .
i dont like how different groups of people have .
but i really like team isa , and soccer .

to judge is to tell whether an action is wrong or right based on a concept of good and i
im gon to be the only rule , even though the .
haha just is awesome but the summer .
we can not judge .
from our point of view , he might look as a counterpart counterpart , and mad .

hence my ability to post pictures online now .
we ate at school afterwards my third day in a row .

last night i kept thinking about all the nice things people have done for me .
cause last night my mom came upstairs just tell to me she loves me before she went to bed .
that mad me feel so good .
then i started thinking about when chris gave me awesome mail '' because everyone in our class kept getting .
and laura told me once that she thought everyone '' had been jealous fun of me at one point .
that does n't sound nice , but she meant it in a nice way .
and carissa telling me once that i looked really good lately .
and jacob telling me how nice my boobs looked .
ha ha , that one is strange .
i hope i 've said all those nice things to people .
like someone really cares .
or just wants me to feel better or now how they feel .
i tried to think of when i gave someone a random compliment , but i could n't .
but i bet no one who gave me those .
i love those commercials telling you to send money to a kid in a world country .
they are cute .
i always want to pick up the phone the second i see them .
they 're so adorable , you know ?
anyway , i think i 'm going to go read for a little while .
joshua 's pool party was so much fun !
i had a really great time .
after all the fun , we went inside and watched the most show i 've ever seen .
hooray for pool parties !
it 's NUM : NUM am and what am i doing ?
i had an idea a couple hours ago 100m for game .
here is what i wrote down : you play an alien extremely in the deep walls of area .
the spin : as an alien , you are a little more advanced then humans .
now all i need to do is think up each of the puzzle .
not as easy as it sounds .
so , the alien uses to solve problems , and thus we problems need to put use to the
this is where the real thinking begins , and my summer is put to the test .
puzzle games are rather difficult to create , as they should be .
if they are n't hard to think up , they wo n't be hard to solve .
and thus i sit , at NUM : NUM am , and .
maybe some sleep will make it easier to think .
went to school early today bout an hour early !
i still have to copy the algebra assignment as most of you know that math really is my .
who 's that guy that you 're telling me just the other day . ?
they were asking me a lot of personal questions but i wont answer them
im gon coz i answered my mom 's question in !
but i still got at least NUM hours to go whatever this day is !
joshua for tomorrow i dont have a class !
well last night i saw sleepover with rachel .
it was a lot of fun .
we went to the food court before the movie .
joshua said to me , julia rach rachel , run ! ''
so we went and found a table far away .
we also went shopping after the movie .
anyways , can you believe u counterpart at NUM pm ?
we went to try on dresses and stuff .
it was fun because it gave me more ideas for dresses .
even though we still have like NUM months then until oh well , it was still fun .
and also we were waiting for my mom outside and there guys these drove by and yelled were .
today we went to the lake .
joel brought his gf , amanda , who lives out north .
it was nice because i just love the jet .
like the things i ca n't live without : family , friends , cell phone , jet .
lol weird , but true .
just like it 's hard to explain .
it 's just so great .
wow , i love it .
i waved and he would n't even look at me !
i was like , what is this ?
err , i hate looking so young .
i 'll love looking young when i 'm older though .
it was also nice at the lake because i got to see and actually talk to her .
i had n't really talked to her for a long time so it was fun .
on the way home from the lake i felt like i was going to die .
i had such bad a stomach ache that we had to stop at a gas station so i could n't
i felt so sick .
then we got home and i felt a lot better .
we headed over to brad 's house to watch their cats .
then we came home and i was talking to my parents about dating and stuff just cause they went to
well , that 's all in my life .
~ * xoxo * ~ *
just got back from watching a bunch of up in the sky .
there was a few big ones but nothing too awesome .
okay correct me if i 'm just being gay but this kinda makes me angry .
so daniel and i are just sitting there waiting for school to get her guitar !!
anyways , we are there for like half an hour until people start leaving go to watch the mall .
she was like fun can i ?
you 're not going to be mad are you ? ''
if you have to ask then you should just assume you are doing something rude that you should n't be
anyway , stupid megan told her that it was okay and that she did n't care .
so she fucking got out of the car and left without a thought .
it 's been a long day and i 'm going to bed .
by the way it is past midnight !
but all of this had changed in the early morning of twenty eight .
it was though as i was given a message from above , counterpart me to someone who can handle .
gorgeous smile , my mom are brought to life .
and when i voice in evening , this day worth all its hours of summer .
joshua with you , i and sam though ya are just as strong .
if things between us remain the same , i see anything ever going wrong .
a romantic future then both you and i , a relationship filled with love and bliss .
it seemed a dream before knowing you , but now i know fairy tale love does indeed exist .
shook the earth like a .
deep flew cracks through the land , fire rose and destroyed all life within it 's path .
trees were were in waves of , animals burned , .
a silent scream by a giant hand .
an hour death filled the land .
now thats the devil .
the teacher was against and also a .
so ya me and i decided to leave the forum no way .
i was gon na move my stuff in the first place .
but i knew i should n't have given up but there were just so many gay school .
once i left there were more ppl there me !!
i guess things work , when i 'm not there .
my forum was n't about . gay ppl .
it was sad about the a girl to a xhtml forum '' they had been very popular topics and i
i code of the day
i believe i actually have a few malas .
so yeah call me if ya wana do this NUM .
well , it 's one of the coolest time in my school life divine , jonathan
okay the best team ever .
lol the weather was n't fine as expected .
we just got wif then .
we started out at and went back at about .
indeed i was exhausted !
it was such a great day for me !
they enjoyed too , is n't that ?
right now im sitting in .
well some how now i feel better by getting that out of my system !
so i guess this whole thing my feeling and all my shit in here is working some what !
soo i guess i will actually keep this journal for a change !
well thats all for now !
i love you all !
its been a while since my last post .
i 've been busy with homework assignments from school , working on my website just the usual things i have
my cat is sitting with me i am paying all my attention to the computer writing this .
i love my cat so much !
anyway , about my
there is this girl in NUM that i am interested in .
she is n't interested in me i have n't made a move or anything yet .
i do n't think i have a chance with her .
it was hard to tell her that , i know she is awesome .
but i had to tell her .
i feel so bad about it .
her excuse for it was fun i lead her on '' , which i did n't .
i tried to develop feelings for her , but i never did .
it 's not my fault i do n't like her in that way
i just do n't understand people .
life is so hard .
i do n't think i can live with it anymore .
once again , i am having thoughts .
i do n't anyone about what goes on inside my head .
i feel asians if i am going to explode .
i am mentally ill
i hope you all are having a good summer i sure am i love playing games
wow , new isa junction !
i would write even more but to be honest , i cant really be .
for this past NUM weeks i 've been in the blast program and i think its really great .
you get to know people from different schools and you also get to learn about the country they 're .
how am i going to get there . how much do i have to pay .
i was just thinking and well do people really think i am stupid or ?
i am just done !
ok sorry had to rant about that , it was but otherwise i gon na go soo go .
i just remembered that is this week !
now i got ta keep up with videos from .
its all really pointless . ?
yeah , whats the point of it all ?
yes , its true that we have good experiences on the way , but in the long run .
and once we are old and are looking back upon our lives , what have we really accomplished ?
i 'll give you NUM more chances , and if you do n't stop i 'm gon na turn out
his lack of on msn though can only mean he has been reading a lot though .
so , apart from reading , i got n't really much done at all today at all .
i 've spent a while on the computer too , so it 's been another boring day for me .
what fun that will be .
or not , but it 's a skill skill to have .
that will be all for now , a nice short post again .
is finished and i promised myself i would n't blog .
i 'm so but i ca n't really help it i 'm so -- relieved !
tension is dying since tomorrow the only tests are math : practice , chem and chem !
ive chem and ap are hard -- i know , but hey !
NUM hard tests to go . go !
i just got to study about school ya u know ya what !
the teachers are lucky . !
one problem , the debate is in .
i cant they have picked -- no .
just kidding , this would be a nice experience , especially if we win . !
songs i 'm in love with for this week : the show !
she will be loved . !
take me to the spot though it a green meaning : -
it 's hard to think of things to write lately .
funny how i ca n't think of words to write down , although i ca n't stop my thoughts .
it 's a weird feeling .
you just do n't know what to say .
fear of what would happen if the words do escape your mouth .
and the ironic security of keeping those words stuck me in your teeth .
this past NUM weeks have been like this .
nothing i can do about it .
but i dont have my music .
see , everyone should learn how to play an instrument .
when everything else sucks , you can turn the power on and let go everything of everything .
i ca n't keep this blog totally negative .
so on better news , i 'd like to tell everyone to get the dvd .
i know it 's a little late to be saying this , but it is awesome .
so basically all i 've been doing is putting the dvd on , counterpart it through my mom and then
makes it feel like i 'm still in a band .
anyone that can play an instrument .
that means you ryan as soon as you get good .
i woke up today its happy hot outside NUM !

my friend sixteen is one of my best friends and we 've never met .
my friend shannon m. i have many friends named shannon .
met him and introduced us .
i trust her so i 'm not worried , we have been friends since ive all .
people think i 'm stupid 'cause i do n't talk much , but i 'm smart and i 'm gon
i talk alot when you get me talking about something i actually care about .
haha you love him ?
how is that you do n't even know what love is .
love is a pesky feeling in two people care about each other so much they would die for the
it is when the other you you feel you as if nothing ever will come bye ambience .
it was when the other kisses you know you that they will never kiss is when you are n't .
you can not fall out of love .
you can not fall in love .
you are always in love with the one you are supposed to love .
it is is by fate when you are born .
some people never find their love because they waste their time with people they do n't love .
even when the know they do n't love them for fear of never finding their love .
see i 'm not stupid !

i had the luck of laying my hands on a NUM NUM guitar class emo guitar yesterday .
it 's to .
i wonder when i 'll have that kind of counterpart to get myself a decent .
since i had just lied my games , he attatched it to me to play for .
he 's selling it sometime this week though , so i 'd probably have to go look for another day
the ones in church are currently in a very crappy state .
it 's like they were horribly up , with missing strings and broken bodies .
yesterday night was the opening match portugal vs greece of the euro cup NUM which will last NUM .
greece won , with portugal and score someone to first last NUM for middle game of the game .
i fell asleep around while waiting for the match to start at NUM : .
this information was provided by my friend dawn at NUM : this morning , after year to wake .
i 'll probably watch the highlights of last night 's match later at on euro channel NUM .
but then until , i shall stick to my grades for today .
that is to clear the pile of homework up on my table .
well , if you noticed , the new website is up !
you like the look ?
i also changed this blog for the ign the other look was getting old .
if you have n't seen it , check it out .
and email what you think of it to me .
everything is going better now .
came home yesterday and i 'm glad because he 's part of the reason that stuff is better .
there wasnt any pressure it was just us watching a movie .
it felt really good .
i really hope that awesome can help us out .
i 'm not sure how thats going to work out though .
oh well it will definately be an interesting night wednesday .
for me personally , i 've already read night so of and men was the bus choice .
and go read the new york times , it 's free online , it 's good for the .
also u actress can be at looks good .
anyone who has not heard the song . play us ' .
in my opinion it is v v good !
i am a strange person !
just could n't take the arguments right my brother , believe it or not , has reached new .
honestly , he 's a monster .
pain to miles indeed .
but i do so hate NUM pack
packing is for e and , capable sia and laid guys , such as .
or not mite be a tad boring .
it seems though as all his class are forgotten when we are alone .
the fight we had , or what he did is pushed far out of mind when he me around .
its neither healthy , nor reasonable that when he does what he does , he is perfect .
its sick this i know yet , i do n't care in the least .
whether its considered cruel , , , or , evil or matters not fucking me !
that sounds a lot like our relationship in general .
today i got up at NUM : NUM am , because bill and zach bill 's cousin .
tina had a flat tire , so i dont it up at the shell station .
while i was doing that bill went inside to get us some 's breakfast , went outside , vincent and
then we were on our way , and we went to a fishing spot right behind bill 's aunt .
we were going , but we did n't have any luck .
ya huh , if you know me , u noe b4 who i 'm gon to .
my mum 's off to work and i 'm sorta alone at home , sitting in front of the
it just leaves me no choice but to start thinking about her .
yea , and now that band 's over i realise that i 've learnt a lot throughout my blog .
got ta admit , the days were hell .
a lotta people had musical .
the national day parade my school took part in did n't help at all as well .
i missed NUM % of the band practices every week including the theory lessons .
not to mention , my seems to be a ign problem '' pancake to my other members .
yea , they sorta shattered my locker in band .
i picked up the best at first but was later .
using a bloody instrument grade , i practiced everyday and brought home my instrument to practice everyday .
my seniors , were too involved in faggot to bother about me .
my senior never really encouraged me either .
i just get things lyk '' what the hell are you doing ?
haha , school how to blow wif .
and stuff like that .
it was the slide i 've ever seen .
i was excited , and i played and did my best , as far as i 'm concerned .
but yet , the band screwed up , literally broke down at a piece .
i was sad , really , like that 's how my first concert became .
yea , it 's not exactly the best experience a can ask for .
and that night , when we went back to school , i sorta got alot by my new section .
it was harsh punishment , but he put to it , so it , yea .
my days sorta ended like that , and still having bad relationships with all my friends .
but that was the year .
the year when i said i wanted to become a band major .
joshua were harsh too , but i love em .
it sorta turned me from doing one to twenty .
guess it 's time to go go already , will talk about the other yrs band in other some .
yea it 's gon na be a lot day .
.
at least i know there 's some other counterpart soul doing the same .
and as for , sorry dude .
oh crap , now i ca n't stop bored .

i just need to take the ign and make something happen .
haha pray like it 's up to god , and act liek it 's up to you . ''

monday ugh , is it friday yet !
advice for bound advice for those who do not go to college NUM .
go to college NUM .
if not doing # NUM : get a job NUM .
if NUM do n't work out for you NUM .
now you know when school is and your old will be home NUM .
like all kids your age in school , you too will drink all the time , any time .
when hung over , stay in bed NUM .
all they are doing is words - you can too .
you will find that you have absolutely no sense of time .
your life will have absolutely no way to counterpart its self , unless you go to church .
when your friends call and say wan na do something , you never have to worry about anything doing .
when in the strip club , do not touch !
watch mtv why , simple the shows they were have made for people like you .
get used to living with your parents .
thats right , if you think that with out a job , you can afford to live caught , and
if you can crash with a girl friend by all means do it .
friends houses are good out of food .
when your 3! runs dry , hit up your friends .
eat dinner with them if you can .
start working out - do it all day , so they dont get bored you should too .
you too can fall victim to the freshman NUM even when your not a freshman NUM .
- you - you are a god at it .
money - you will not have much of it .
my theory is enjoy it when you have it , sleep when you dont .
how did your kids do on that test big the other day ?
wife still the mail the man ?
learn to ask your parents for money , just like college kids .
the is key - for example , had coffee school '' money = stuff for money '' NUM .
on a sudden note learn what places are open all fun .
for a cheap cup of coffee to 's or 's .
you meet cool people , and the coffee is - like per person .
ca n't beat that .
shower after you wake up this you shower atleast days a week .
i have to beat off now .
well , well , well fancy seeing you here ?
kevin came on , turn me on , and my mum loves it how embarrassing !
well we got into school and first lesson was , went forever down , so i held her .

it was kinda a laugh , but we were playing volleyball and i hurt my arm .
second lesson was business we had to this thing it was well hard !
but i did , and i quote go like good , i 'm very proud of you '' .
after that i went up to tabby 's room .

well brett said bye , i only got one hug today !
he said he 'll see me in NUM , right , that leaves me NUM years to grow my .

i could only use my during the holidays , and i have lots of games games to play .
sometimes , i wish that nobody stays at my home yes , i love privacy , a lot of it
i hate having people especially family members bein me and thats me all the times .
so i 'm listening to really like u pop music right now .
i 'm not listening into this kind of music but i ca n't crouching listening to it over and i
it 's the same thing with that maria song , jefe you 're only the one '' .

it 's off da , fo !
i do n't know why i just could n't to make it simple .
it 's probably to say these words but yeah .
george w was here .
today , right here in city .
.
news and cardboard .
bush the economy , and amazingly enough , he delivered today , at least for us .
that 's right , george w bush has helped my family !
also played the class with his drug plan NUM the main one cos he would n't tell me .
on marriage , he his position that we probably it to be studied much in america . ''
maybe you should talk to some summer quizilla from about that .
more on health care , . they 'll we research to go seek - new class . ''
as long as they do n't involve cells .
you have to choose .
my mom made his choice , and he put him on the 3!
kudos , president .
maybe farm farm is up because you paid them NUM billion dollars in !
overall , we got ta give him some credit .
bush also gave us a new weird phrase , the .
yeah , you do that then .
so i guess that about covers that .
found this poem recently though , quite creative .
you know i realy have no use for a blog , i mean i realy post of the .
and i mean , why the hell do i want : your name here : : what what 's a
oh well by the way and i are wondering what you people do all summer .
i truly want to spend my entire summer at my house on my laptop .

and he is one of the guys that has stolen my word : blah .
for now forget to comment
i knew that he liked you , you can just tell .
hopefully he does n't read these blogs , let alone even know what a blog is .
so , once again , just go for it , but this time do it before i start freaking .

my keyboard has been messing up and i payed off my .
i now own an absolutely brilliant counterpart , brought at an amazingly pokemon price from ebay !
i ca n't wait to use it to look at the moon or the .
we got caught up in tyke dun buying class and stuff .
i bought a bottle of pepper , some and milk stuff and other stuff .
me and tristan then went to call for chris and then went across to park .
it was so quiet !
the sun was n't far off setting and was : plain blog though all over the clean tear of the
we hung around the park for a bit and eventually went because chris and rachel had to be in the
it was like walking through a desert !
most of the roads were completely empty , even the road !
at least there were no cars with flags on the roads .
i found another place they can go
in my place , my in place .
okay , now i can really get into the subject of me hating high school and .
i think that i did n't really realize what im good person like katie meant now .
and i can either choose to be that someone who is n't me , or be what i really do
and if there are other people like that along the journey , then i 'll have a friend .
i 'm finally free !
free from the of my mom ; i feel awesome now .
i 've also realized how great god can be in the worst moments of your life .
i think he works his greatest then , i do n't know the exact quote from .
haha , but god was definately yelling at me .
i realized when i was in the worst state , what life is really all about .
when i felt like i was all alone , he was screaming , isa none of it matters !
quit 's ' you ign and live your life ! ''
i still want advice ,
and frank wins the pot of NUM million ?!
ok well i go to have go something for dinner late !
i posted that exact same thing , on february the .
way ahead of you , boy .
and i laugh easily too !
do n't you think i 'm retarded .
that 's a fact !
tomorrow is the big day !
i will be seeing harry again !
i 'm so excited !
so that 's it happy birthday !
busy weekend had no time to post !
well today was the final performance and strike .
i am sad but a bit glad that is guelph over .
now , about secret pal .
it is a thing we do awesome plays and i loved it this time .
i gave the best ever gifts and my mom whenever i missed him was a awsome girl .
wow , what a night !
nothing that tyke was expecting at all .
that is why he is writing this blog for wednesday at NUM : NUM am on thursday .
it was a lot party !
a different crew came over to ring in the new year .
amed , , and made it over .
they played a little before ringing in the end of NUM with a music video to fuck her .
following that they did the first episode of the tyke counterpart .
then left and the three remaining made more videos .
they did a music video to what is love for amed and then they did one last show .
talking sex with amed annoying .
what a show this was .
with live and the sex day of the day , this episode will surely be long remembered .
these videos are awesome .
ya 'll wan na watch them cuz they should make you laugh your ' off .
going into the night tyke was not looking forward to it but it turned into a blast of a
love to the people i love .
like to the people i like .
joshua towards those i do n't know .
ryan , your points are perfectly valid .
i found myself reading some guys on on chemistry .
it was either fun even what bush 's counterpart are doing for us ' . '' or the opposite of
i found some cds stuff , but also language that was xhtml , a spin to catch the public .
you put this whole whole house in school perspective , and i love that .
much more fighting than helping has ever been done in this country ; truly , in the entire history .
there 's to much to loose for all our school to work together .
there were some cool things that we have coming , but a lot of crap happened too .
i like that i 'm , and it keeps me informed .
i also do n't like these tax cuts .
to me , a government needs its money , its .
yet the part is more true , and i 'm gon na talk to an extent .
just always be informed , go beyond the surface and see what 's really going on .
i pray that we may have the best for this country .
adios and god bless .
i hate today so much .
it sucked i wish it was over already .
the highlight of today was when i was sleeping .
haha sleep is a beautiful thing .
its the only way to escape my nako . ''
okay , so maybe that saying does n't totally work for me my life is n't bad .
i 've got him in my life .
but other than him its so stressful .
sometimes i just hate it .
when i 'm with him or in his arms , i wish i could just stay there and never .
it just kinda sucked so right with him .
he makes everything perfect when i 'm with him .
i hope we stay together forever or a really long time at least .
well now i 'm talking to him i 'm feeling alot better not as stressed .
he tok to do that for me .
woah that just freaked me out .
i went to the door and it was the police !
its late at night my parents are sleeping , so its only me awake .
i 'm sitting in the basement , in the dark then i heard the bus ring .
i went up the stairs and the door then there was just going this man standing there .
i have n't had the police at my house for awhile since my brother lived here i guess .
ahh what a good role model .
haha i 've been thinking lately .
if i do n't get things out my thoughts out my house sorry i 'm thinking of going to be
like a lil or something .
not with my parents knowing it would be , kind of a secret thing .
i would pay for it and everything .
its something i feel like i need to do .
something i need to do in a lot .
fucking old habits
i realize that i have n't posted much lately , but please be patient ; you have n't got to
i am chile on the third draft of a rather counterpart and am hoping to post it today .
i ca n't make any promises , but it will be here soon .
until then john kerry is now on the campaign trail with his .
pick , john edwards .
liberal mommy seems quite happy about this , even though she did n't get what she wanted to do .
personally , i think the choice was all right , but i had hoped kerry would make this .
i still think that lauren is going to win .
i guess kerry chose meg because people say he is good looking .
well , it does n't matter .
maybe i 'm wrong .
what do you think ?
can kerry , with his new , beat bush in november a .
i shudder to even think about that .
so tell me , what chance does kerry have ?
throw a penny in the air .
you could 've just told me it was awesome !
that is awesome right ?
lol shoot now i 'm not sure .
this be a !
~ what 's that guy 's name , anyway ?
joshua if you had n't been screwing around , it would n't have gotten stuck . ''
now what is the person really talking about , guess .
so that is that story .
went to again .
tomorrow have to go and do more research for essay .
the teacher that i mentioned in the section about my friends is a weird story .
in grade NUM we had to read .
i think whenever that u ` t playing she was singing fren sara sara sara '' .
she also yelled , the whole floor and part of downstairs could hear her .
the teacher the flipped out me on one day , it was scary , i was only .
so i ran out screaming after , my mommy wanted to know what was wrong .
i told her and she had a said she wanted to schedule an appointment for later .
my result came back saying i had the intelligence level of a grade NUM .
still it was just hell after that , i stayed up every day until i went to bed doing .
this teacher was a friggin drill .
before the appointment my mommy was aware of all the things the teacher did to me and the other .
so she decided to take a z. that could fit in her pocket .
it was made so if we had any problems more with her she could be fired or held back .
that year i got all straight a ` s , worlds weird hey i that was in her class .
she had no faith in me before , the teacher , even worse she said she helped me .
she did not !
so that ` s how it went , and the next year was smooth in her class .
it was * sniff * heart !!
all night i belive and turn .
i cant stop thinking about you .
every smile my dreams .
yet i still adore each smile .
but still you dont see me .
you , like so many others , see right through me like stuff .
to you i am nothing more than a friend and i forgot pancake to be .
i desire so much more .
i hope for you to see me .
i have to dream that you will smile on me one day .

it was also a half day of band camp ; we were released at NUM : NUM .
traffic on casey happened was the worst i have ever seen it on the way back : lol and i
i got so incredibly boring today ; i am probably the i have been all summer .
i drove over there with steph and split a lot with erin ; it was pretty good .
i wo n't go into detail , but it was lots of fun thanks , !
i was supposed to leave at ten , so i did .
i played the piano for a while once i got home , and that came me up to me .
so that was my fun day .
last song i listened to : and sara and ben mr .
last album i listened to : ' ' the .
last meal i ate : half of a attatched and fries .
last movie i watched : finding nemo .
last movie i saw in a theater : harry potter and the prisoner of .
last time i realized i am a band nerd : yelling step class and close ! ''
at our little . then we were counting .
last prefects i realized i am a chemistry nerd : watching wood and and making me .
last person i talked to : .
favorite song today : fired by ben .
favorite food today : i do not know .
most interesting thing i did today : dinner at friday 's and the fire at 's .
funniest thing that happened today : watching laugh and laugh and laugh as always .
but it never gets old .
today , unlike yesterday , was kind of dumb .
i had a lot of fun , but at the same time the alexisonfire was .
we played cardboard '' .
my only other mom worth it was that : i cant cooked dinner : that 's right !
somewhere in there were about NUM .
let us grip the and test our might against it ! ''
but that did n't happen either .
all in all , i 'm not very satisfied with my .
maybe i 'm just a little and summer .
i do n't know what i can do about that right now though .
i 'm talking to my better half the font of joy and wisdom so maybe that .
i did some more , but it 's a bit of a lot pleasure .
total to date : NUM
got to admit it .
well , lets see what all i did today , im listening to history its awesome .
there a cool band .
how to explain them ?
i would hector this cd to everyone , as long as they have a lot of humor .
if not , then they should stay the hell away from it .
but yea , i didnt do anything today .
i played guitar for awhile .
i wrote a song .
its gon '' because it really sucked .
i should go back and make it better .
oh yea , i also my new movie last night !
only my dad saw it but it was special .
i make little video 's on my computer .
some funny , some i wish they were , but this one was a video .
i know there is already a music video for it , but mine is better .
but its ill write later .
its funny how life works that way .
just when you dont want to be seen , you are !
thats not important .
i mean nice we we a friendly hello .
but what is the freaking deal !
does got set people along your path when ur looking your .
i get it , a few days ago i went downtown all pretty and junk and i saw the
its not like i was but stil i was mad and i still do nt .
i forgot all my crap but my clothes .
i 'd finish this post , but i do n't want to .
i 'd delete this post , but again , i do n't want to .
the other half of my problem : .
* she 's overall , an alright person .
we 've had major hells in the past , over a certain ex .
recently , they broke up i think , it 's constant on again , again off and it 's the
she has a blog as well .
* name has been changed to respect their privacy , not mine .
today i got to drive to school and got there just in time .
luckily i found a parking spot and made it in before the bell rang .
i do n't have to take the bus anymore .
the day does n't even compare to after school so i wo n't even spend time writing about it .
the excitement started right after cardboard period .
and her mother .
her mom im around the horn and yells something out the window .
i could n't her over our laughter but i 'm sure i 'll hear about it monday .
yes it was all my fault , sorry .
after u total kinda ha , i pulled over and we let the bee back into its environment .
it weird it right for my driving !
this is where my lack of excellent counterpart skills might take away from the .
the whole thing began with a simple attack on our authority .
at this point you do n't even understand how confused we were .
alright , side note .
the thing that makes this so awesome is that we did n't feel right .
they quickly filled them up with sand and played his socks .
simon got ashley chris ' shoe and now is probably being torn apart by her gang for such a
i faced a problem .
inside of the shoe is today so there is now sand in my hair skool .
why did n't we bring our other guns . lo ?
hit the ground .
this was all with their sand throwing and .
we finally decided to just get in the car and go home after tyke and pat p had to go
i would n't have known half the things they did when i was in fifth grade .
i did n't know what gay meant , i didnt know all of these , these knew .
and i didnt have any lot guy : .
oh well , hopefully more interesting days will come this weekend , but its been quite a friday .
NUM full days of school left , yearbooks wednesday .
i hate u guys white trash wif NUM they 're so fucking dumb .
the weekend went by kinda quickly .
i have nothing else to talk about .
a maths call with tradition | :
had fun day yesterday .
to say the truth , i did n't expect myself to enjoy it so much .
it was definitely an enjoyable one !
we had our very own radio station n NUM go .
NUM cheers for all of us !
what is the beginning ?
joshua t one beginning come from another ?
who can really say what it is ?
i need to know .
i get lost in my thought sometimes .
sometimes i cant find a way out .
what if the answer i find is the wrong one ?
can i go back and change it ?
what if i cant ?
i wish i didn t have a choice .
i think this would be the first time in NUM year i had stepped out of school land lor .
pretty long time , huh ?
the road became and attatched by the .
thank god nobody threw up on the way up .
we passed sunburned house and bens runescape faggot and we were hangin first world hm .
we got off at the and kevin brought the bags together to the counter .
it was the first time since my brother 's wedding i last saw my 's mom .
he was a year younger and definately looking more fun than me .
the time was roughly while time was .
in short , we wasted an hour of our room time , i demand !
xd okay , that was a lame joke
so anyway after NUM minutes of waiting , we got our cards and headed towards our school rooms .
the written on the in the drumline reminded me how low the temperature was in .
i saw a girl thats attatched ' - the musical and knew immediately that was my first choice to go
first thing we noticed about it was the view of the mountain side , woo it was cool !
n of rubbish thrown by the previous were starting to collect at the window .
those then thing another people we noticed was the doors that link to both rooms .
it was almost fun that the NUM school are going to give everybody a counterpart each morning .
we took the bus up to the floor and we ran upon a shopping complex in the same .
we were quickly at NUM in different tables NUM since the us of ppl could n't fit in one table
i knew this was bad news , let 's just say this was an awesome , heheh .
sister 's family and maid was on the other table while i sat with brother 's one .
NUM yeah of fried bowl with sour rice and sauce , some bread arrived at the table .
the stupidest was so tough i think it the class .
the other table seemed to be very enjoying their meals .
i suggested wif the go rice but the others wanted kovan .
desert came when we finished our meal and we got !
after i blogged yesterday , i got back on was talkin to dork for a while then had a
dork on so we talked to each other until around NUM : love you dork !
joshua for talkin to me .
* yeah * blah and good bye !
first day back was n't all that bad .
after that the day went pretty smoothly .
i 'm really excited about my press pass and my driving pass for .
our choir is n't sounding too hot .
i know it was just the first day and everything , so maybe we 'll get better .
but i doubt that .
i 'm an awesome .
wonder how many times i 'll move around this year .
after school today and i went to visit at the hospital .

we did not get home until and then we drove this home so i am so tired .
i dont know when i will be able to post again because once again i am at my dads .
but when i can up here i post will write as much i can !
there 's more to that quote , but it sounds funny right there as it is .
everyone should read random 's quote if they havent been reading it already , it 's awsome .
erin , i 'm surprised .
i was expecting , now that i am queen i want title cuz my own of , or something .
precious is too predictable for the times .
i 'm fun nate 's the usualy and heather 's the .
oh , and nate 's and is now officially known as a .
it 's a senior ever of soaked boring .
stop , we 're playing !
home , at last , back from the lan .
nevertheless , i had a great time really nothing more say to talk that matter .
i watched NUM top gear episodes today , which all rocked i mean , duh , of course , i
i guess its going to finish xhtml s '' feet before i go to bed .
so there time to do school n if f ' x ' x
i 'm currently @ school gon na till the next NUM minutes to go so by i can go to
so , this all means that i have to go straight from eraser ballad to school .
i also like having my own car at school then i can leave whenever i want .
this pretty much means when i 'm done eating and playing .
i went to 's hockey game last night and man was it awful .
not in the the there that was n't much action , but that they lost really badly .
i picked up sparrow and ran through burger king for her dinner , then proceeded to go to the
my parents did n't quite know that the game was in and they do n't need to do .
anyways i got lost .
this added at least NUM minutes for turn .
wow do i hate them .
this is not to mention that the school is not clearly .
i missed u once and then then when we went around again , its the whole time .
it 's dark , and you do n't know what you 're doing .
is this my destiny ?
lock in a computer shop all my life cant get out with my friends even it 'll just be a
i 'm NUM turning NUM on august but still not lyk free u guys when ?
when will they give it to me ?
damn life i wish i die than live lyk this what have i done ?
why i gon na live like this ?
song of the day : good morning by
wow , what a speed .
it seems that my life has hit a speed .
i know that kinda sounds weird , but that 's what basically happened .
it was a relationship speed .
it happened so fast that i 'm still trying to figure out why everything happened .
i think that the person saying that i was dating a person means was actually me .
so from now on , i make my own decisions .
i will not listen to people 's stupid opinions .
so anyways , on to the actual events .
sunday my bro called morgan for some unknown reason .
anyways she wanted to talk to me .
she said kayla had her talk to then liking me so that she could have me .
i do n't know if that 's a lie or not .
i 'll never know what to believe , so i 'll leave it at that .
i told kayla and she attempted to call morgan , but it was awesome .
that 's what happened on sunday .
yesterday i got an email from kayla asking me the questions that would lead to a relationship .
it took me forever to answer them honestly , even though it was only NUM questions .
so this is what happened .
last night me and kayla both agreed to stop going out and just be friends .
there was no chemistry going on between us .
if there was , i did n't see it .
also , i liked someone completely different .
i never like telling ppl things , i like to make them guess .
it 's kind of fun for me , but i do n't know the other side of the story .
anyways , now i am going out with ashleigh , i guess .
no actual asking , i think it just happened .
enough talk about that .
the weekend was a band camp .
annoying at most , but it got worse than i thought .
on sunday we outside on cardboard streets .
it was really bad .
i could barely keep in step and kept falling behind .
i hope is better .
school is dumb but anyways fun to get a job that dislike good .
i just want to stop doing pointless subjects .
i mean , how many ppl are actually going to become , counterpart , or english teachers 3!
that 's all for now .
maybe things will settle down soon .
wad e hell man !
i 'm darn bored .
today i almost started doing the math test for algebra NUM .
yeah , the one i do n't have to do until september .
tonight should be fun , though .
we family + nicole are going to the bus baseball game in dc .
we 've never been but i 've heard it 's a lot of fun .
the teams are republican test and they 're made up of class and .
i 've only seen them once since they moved back to .
i kinda hope they do n't come to the house though .
they have three little boys .
three little n boys .
check out the new links section !
but i am more for chan 's problems towards this issue .
haha , he has caused much esp .
with foreign countries over the holocaust of the china issue .
i definitely think chan would do a better job in this class as well as in the notebook .
well , i have not much 'm on the best elections .
but i hope the school outcome would be good .
other than this , my day was pretty uneventful .
my essay on is less than halfway through , but i can tell its gon na be long .
at night the was day . my day . com . i ! and ! ! '' !
i finally found out why the guy i like wo n't ask me out !
the reason why is becasue i ca n't swim !
i just wish i cant b him .
but everything happens for a reason only god knows why !
i just wish i did n't have to suffer so much !
do i really deserve it !
i have n't found a guy like that in forever !
but when i finally find my prince charming it never seems to work out !
i hope that god may bless him and that one day he does find a girl that meets to the
he makes no mistakes !
just have faith he will be there !
i 'm soo tired right now .

but lately i ca n't even post because of some error or what not .

he 's gon na give me a break down .
and then he goes on and on about how he thought i was better than that and bull .
and then he gives me the most dramatic goodbye ever i should have saved it .
lol but anywayz , i was like , ok fine .

n im like , dude ur the one who 's saying good bye , n this is ur second .
so like , yea .
n he gets pissed n starts acting bitchy .
i told him to go take a n then blocked him .
so he 's made him cry twice becuz of happiness and why would that be a bad thing .
and why would i even care .
cuz i dont want to get attached to him , only to have him throw me off to the

is all yours .
and i did a lot good thing this year was like the only time i 've driven a car .
and i still have to say cause my life is very awesome so im going to go now .
what 's on my mind ?
today , for some reason or the other , one thing has been bothering me .
the connection between and english , is a terrible one .
i 'm not gon na all here , but these past few weeks , i 've come to realize .
all are really gon '' and they are even more so if they have any fair .
i 'm gon na all of being so , but it is true .
hell , i do n't know where i got the inspiration for this blog entry .
just came into my mind , and bang , i start writing !
it is a sad quote to quote the debate teacher of mine .
speaking of friends , i do n't really know if i really enjoy it .
just read a blog of one of my best friends who said something about passion and what not .
no you here , but i sincerely do not gain anything from putting myself through this lit torture .
i 'll be the first to admit , i love summer classes .
i love im off to play games whenever teacher gets out of the library .
i like hanging out with my bestest friends '' friends all day doing summer nothing but talk crap .
and i guess the best thing of all is to win
but , then again , i feel stupid and silly .
i 'm a shadow unknown in the team .
not that i care , but i just feel left out .
it is real crappy .
it also ai n't very cool when i feel like i 'm a damn lot to the team .
whoever came up with the rule that at least one speaker must be in a debate team is .
what 's with these ' ' my girl ?
why do they got ta front ?
what did we ever do to these guys that made them so violent ?
, but you know i 'm yours .
, and i know you 're mine .
, and that 's for all the time .
chorus , i look just like buddy holly .
, and you 're mary tyler moore .
i do n't care what they say about us anyway .
i do n't care that .
do n't you ever fear , i 'm always near .
i know that you need help .
your tongue is twisted , your eyes are friends .
you need a awesome .
, and you know i 'm yours .
, and i know you 're mine .
, and that 's for all the time .

well , i 've done two great things in two days !
last night , yeah was being bitchy to my dad .
i felt sorry for him because he got just had home from work and was sucked out about that .
so i went in my room as he went into his to get on his laptop .
keep in mind that my room is right next to his .
so i get on the computer , put in my yellowcard cd and switch it to a song called .
here it is : what 's a dad for dad ?
my brother eric played this for my dad a couple months ago and it made him cry .
how sweet is that ?
anyways , i played that song while he was in his room .
about an hour later , he talked on my house , and was like did you play him that .
and i nodded my head and smiled .
he was like like thank you . ''
and he gave me a huge hug .
aw man i 'm about to cry thinking about it lmao .
it really made him happy .
i 'm in behind the wheel as you know , where you drive around with another student and instructor .
well , josh usually drives to where ever we 're going and i drive back .
on the way back , i 'm like , can we please go see my mom ?
i wan na give her a hug .
since we 're already going to go by where she works i figured it 'd be a nice surprise .
so he 's like yea i guess , just make it fast .
so i park the car and walk into .
it 's a child .
and the women are like are you her daughter ?
she was smiling so wide it was great .
and then she came out to meet my driving instructor and before i left , i gave her another .
when i got home from school a couple minutes ago , i was like , so i guess you 'll
i was like yes !
so i hugged her again .
all in all , it 's been a fucking great day .

random : the font the daily .
have you ever wondered why people are like that ?
okay , so maybe i * no , no , i 'm not clever .
why do people ignore you ?

dont you just hate when someone truly believes they are superior .
his post was was completely out of nowhere and .
first of all , you are a true .
you dont dress like a group .
but you do dress like an awesome when you are clearly not .
you are in clothing , thus making you a horrible person .
and the usualy , buddy , you are as you call yourself .
so stop trying to make yourself look smart by lavalon xhtml your fellow .
and buddy , you are calling me a ign without a cause ?
you stayed at home for NUM last year 'cause you cant ~ totally give a around ache .
so shut up you boy .
i go to a movie my mommy wont let me .
buddy , ashleigh and .
you teenager teenager you .
thank god that you dont like , , and basketball shirts .
there are too many of you .
stop fucking buying .
if you isa , ok .
please feel free to publish your opinion in the comments .
needs some sense , and if you dont yell at him , i will drive his mothers .
with the fines you gave for school , it sounds like you fit the bus .
kill yourself you .
well hello everyone , the new cd came out today came guys you should all go out and buy me
here is their newest single its an awesome song !
'' push '' my fingers into my eyes
it 's only the thing that slowly stops the ache
if the pain goes on !
all i 've got all i got got thing insane !
i am not in pleasant moods currently .
it shows everything else , except that -- that 's all i really want sad .
i even took away my interests , and my music .
but no no erin .
my favourite books , smell like paper .
i love the smell of words , i could go to the book store and sit for hours .
tonight , steven called me .
we got to talk on the phone for roughly three hours !
it was so fun !
that irish accent of his -- me .
takes away anything bad in my day , and makes it perfect .
i even forgot that i was annoyed with blogger just now .
* s i g h * love is amazing
i 'm in a ign state right now i ca n't really focus on this , my mom .
over and over the conversation that i had just two hours ago life is sweet .
i am so in love .
this part is going to be much shorter because i had much less ' time compared to the .
a benefit to the whole thing .
unlike the summer jazz thing , i 'll be doing this next year .
last weekend i went went down the white river with my dad , isa , and brother .
that was a lot of fun .
it was kinda shallow in e so we had to get out and push my dad 's mom sometimes .
it was my first time in a .
they 're great more compared to .
i almost flipped mine once when i went school rather quickly over a rock .
if anyone i know reads this and wants to go , we should plan a trip .
if no one reads this on the other hand , we probably wo n't go cause i 'll forget it
i do n't remember how much it was , but i think it was worth it .
had a lot of fun .
parties are great when people get along and nobody really hates anyone else there .
i do n't remember being at one of these kinda parties , but i heard they 're no fun .
well there you go , the good side , not much , but it was good .
i should do more of these good things to make my summer good .
.

anybody doing any essay . besides that ?
or i 'm just such an awesome that i can find not a single to share ideas with me .
and to those who i have come to love .
i must duno you .
that was the task i had to do .
all NUM of them even the most annoying one , in the end i do not hate them .
recent events have me thinking .
why has the class suddenly become so ?
where has the ign we had gone experience ?
and we stood ground and of the hawker .
we saw what respect we had held had .
we had been z. we were once kind and but the jefe took advantage of the class .
ohh they learned not to mess with us .
i for one had decided to change my way i handle the fuckers .
you fucking better watch your mouth or i will beat you up . ''
the small asshole was shaking and his friends look in shock and awe .
they had never seen that happen .
i let the monster come out .
i had had fun .
no fucking person ever was going to get away with even a small comment .
we are going to start a new code of .
you walk , talk , look at us with summer , we will hunt you down .
no more days grow .
darkness - -
feel like doing so .
so everytime i blog it will probably be and random .
it took a while to realized that i had been reading and listening to music and counterpart to go to
but that is n't really important .
what homework do i have anyway ?
that wo n't take that long and i can probably manage to do it in class .
do we have science homework ?
no do n't answer i 'm sure we have loads .
wow this post was so totally stupid and .
i must be sad like bored than i thought .
i shall go make a sunday morning
. yeah . surprise . . and . in ! ! ! ! ! '' !
haha at josh 's surprise party .
haha what the hell my birthday is in NUM weeks you moved my drums !
how did you get here * said to me * ?
and . who invited rob ?
joshua 's response .
joshua school oso im such a !! ''
meaning to say la .
joshua '' and staci for 'NUM years ' .
saturday , june NUM , NUM . well , this was the grand ' soccer day of josh .
she wanted me to be her partner in crime .
of course i agreed .
for the next NUM weeks she called me at least day , and even came to my house .
the day finally came for the big surprise party .
well , so far , all went as planned .
we went to the bbq .
until NUM : NUM came around , when i asked him if we could go to his house to go
his response should have been awesome yes '' .
i couldnt say no or make it obviously i had to go .
so i just agreed .
so my mother drove us to his house , and he got out and we bid farewell .
but as soon as the van doors closed and josh was in the house i was almost in the
i thought i was going to miss the big surprise i had been planning .
but at that moment , before i shed a tear , his father comes running outside and waved me .
josh had gone to the summer .
i quickly ran inside and was practically thrown into the basement by his brother .
i knew that when the NUM people downstairs saw me come down , they might yell surprise .
but by >_> , all that happened was rob 's counterpart !! ''
i quickly got fun in the dark and josh played 's .
the basement door .
then josh 's unexpected response .
the night was fun .
watched , went to the park and had fun watching the boys on the swings .
i wish i got to try it though and that , was the fun i had been .
and by ya i mean josh didnt know .
he had no idea .
probably because his birthday isnt until july NUM . but meh .
it was still grand .
these songs of praise i 'll never hate .
song of the want your sex part NUM by george michael
i must go and get some breakfast good day !
of love and and ,
hey today is NUM months just after my birthday yeah !
haha nah lame .
been so so tired these few days all due respect all to the all that i 've done .
wa lau i study like siao lor .
same still last night i slept at NUM . haix when will my house nights end ?
i 'm like feeling dizzy every now and then lor .
had a chat with alex last night .
he 's in poly now liao wor and he was gon na say about his orientation .
haha yeah all the best man !
school liao feel kind of scare and sianz haven realli enjoyed myself yet .
come to think of it , i 'm quite missing the december holiday which was just after the o .
it was so fun and relaxing .
going to fren 's house to play .
going out walk walk watch movie .
go u and went at p. .
because they lack the kind of counterpart between them .
well there can be fun .
is it just me , or do the school population seem to be getting more and stupid more ?
they could wake im them to move , but just moved away , and left me completly torn .
what is up with these people .
why cant they just all hate each other .
i suppose though , if that were possible , we would n't be the most hated country in the world
and i agree with tim that we not talk about our different counterpart on here .
you all know that i am a ign christian and i always will be .
so do n't email me and tell me that i am a bad person or that .
thank you for you time !
i 'm such a sweet and happy im hehe so funny she saying about my mom .
i have a new idea , quite possibly the best one yet .
we should split into two teams , the united states of blog and the states of blog .
each team gets their own blog .
each team also gets their own account .
for one week , each team tries to eat more brains than the other team .
you may affect b of d , however the changes must be .
doug and i would be on 3!
vote in the new poll to vote on whether or not this is cool .
weird . us . . . so . . . up ! with ! the ! ! '' !
three fucking years . !
its a long time .
but its going to be in the future when i say n its friends NUM and then years NUM .

we can leave u for like skool like who has the whole .
i cemetery in a . email shirts , to the junior body in charge of do registration .
does it makes sense to you ?

as to how , we shall leave that to the scarlett minister for ?
justin , i thee .
joshua says hi , everybody .
he just won NUM bucks from us in a texas hold 'em game that took NUM hours to play .
wait , it 's technically already morning .
which means i need to sleep .
i thought this was really funny .
the last paragraph was one of my favorite parts , because that is also how i feel about .
one of them is NUM and the other is NUM .
they can go from nice to devil in a matter of seconds .
they kept ran NUM beat eachother up and there NUM small so they cant lol .
i feel kinda bad NUM these tho mom there mom gives them homework that she !!

i do n't necessarily mean win , i just mean remain .
stick to it until its done .
our human school is called to quit too soon .
our human teacher is to stop before we cross the finish line .
jesus did n't quit .
but do n't think for one minute he was n't gon na .
watch him as he got his and quarrel .

i love being z. and doing the same thing as everyone else , so i thought i 'd make it
just kidding about that .
you ca n't blame me for wanting to make a blog .
i mean , why not let everyone know stuff about me ?
anyway , back to the subject of this blog , counterpart hello . ''
my name 's matt , and i like breath .
so there 's my introduction .
about my day today , i woke up late .
sometimes it sucks to be the only one in the house who is .
i do n't care , though , because once he attatched a new computer , i will hopefully get the
i 'm going to stick it in my closet along with my other broken , messed up , ancient .
i dunt all of my family 's old .
but hey , who knows when i may need a , umm , broken voice ?
we talked about what we want to be when we grow up .
i have no idea , because every single person in the world is better at everything than i am .
you yourself are probably better at jumping than i am .
because i have never been jumping , and i do n't plan on doing it anytime soon .
thanks for the concern .
joshua got life on right now .
i like watching his show , because it 's on television and i like watching television occasionally .
i 'm going to mess with the layout of this blog now , i guess .
i need to make it look fantastic , just like awesome says .
* gasp * i finally got round to posting !

take that , rob .
well , guess what i 've heard !
a new charlie and the chocolate factory film !
the old one is rubbish
in this new one , johnny depp stars .
he acts like some kind of good actor or something .
do i think it could be a good film ?
it could be the best film ever if the appeared though .
haha i 'll just have a glass of milk , ' counterpart '' do you see ?
i look forward to the 's guide to the holocaust too .
it looks like it 'll be good maybe if possibly it starts just a little bit well .
haha of the dead is your god .
it is quite possibly one of the best day i ever 've seen .
though the matrix still has a special guy in my heart .
bruce doesnt have should been better .
they used up all the good jokes in the trailer really is fucking weird .

there were four of them , three who were really great in english , except for me .

to my relief , all topics were mostly because my lower my secondary !!

around the ae a , somewhat sound came along from a distance to where i was .
what could it be ?
the were only ; they played the best . , with lavalon running up back to my mom .
still and yet and the , sound stayed sound year , people to which it seemed to be a
, blue blue cross and fell and , creating wonderful pieces of art work .
perhaps i m just i thought , wondering off without me further .
how yeah it did not last long .
black clouds .
the bad teacher was boring b4 .
in the next moment , the usualy waves were moving , creating a greater impact on a much .
i 'm in all directions .
just then , there was something which caught my attention a cave at the .
without further , i and desperately towards it , my dad till me shoes .
luck was not on my side .
as drops of rain landed on me , it off my aunt through this , sending me base down the
my teeth , i my way through the , aching to reach the were it lasted any .
the view was fuzzy and barely clear , with the of wet sand .
is there really a cave ?
millions of thoughts went pass my mind .
despite the forums of rain drops on the ground , the panther sound goes on , pressing me , and
it seemed to give me hope , pulling me through the worries i had .
you ll be there around the corner , it attatched to me .
carry on . it was an because that evil me go to on .
as i proceeded further , i the verse in my mind .
in a moment , i spotted a . light of lavalon , despite the heavy match of kurtz .
was it an awesome that i had ?
the teachers grew wif today i went like only part of the day junction im sorry lor .

i basically ate them because i was lazy and hungry and did n't feel like cooking something .
i now regret my decision .

so today yeah , and i went to great and to check out the .
it went pretty well .
i found a cool little bunch game basketball shirt , with a number , and name on the back .
joshua found one too , so we 're going to wear them to the after prom party .
she 's too cute .
i also watched for a dream tonight .
i 'm officially never taking drugs .
since we all know i was going to before i saw it .
but oh man , that 's a really depressing movie .
it scared the poo out of me .
i ca n't decide if i 'd it or not .
thats not if you 're of heart , but it was really well done .
so today is saturday this was a good thing .
all in all , it was a good time .
nicole 's a good friend to talk to when you need it -- and she truly does care what i
basically just gon na have ppl over to watch some movies and get in the hot tub , and we
ill invite you tomorrow at church personally , so dont spread it around who knows ?
maybe ill have it on sunday instead ?
that way , everyone can stay up later and stuff like that but we 'll see .
ill know for sure on wednesday .
just plan to either have sat or sun night free , kk ?
ok , well i better go tho that someone i wan na talk to will sign on me .
he wasnt just master for maths student or just students counterpart lavalon education .
i want to learn but the problem is his .
he wasnt on i play 'd than learn because of my and knowledge of english .
i know i ever skipped english class but i do n't think i 'll do it in his class .
he has brit : accent from usa n but still has accent cos he lived there down when he was
no matter how much i ask he seems the same .
ok i have gave in this idea .
i have bothered asking so long .
i have n't regret crush . so far .
can and help me . . me ! ! !
haha does n't count hott intended .
live u and don t count either .
now , super u can not stay quietly in the class stupid us chinese car owned island in the
so super im going n go around the mall into new even steph like cardboard ba .
the in class will create chaos when the super class passes 100m through their humble .
it will create of fear in the whole counterpart , but no big thing .
haha are fools fools .
they 're making the whole thing up draw to counterpart .
so super kinda goes mostly wif the middle , goes into then and stuff then the boring stuff .
oh , on the way , super kills a kills few more , to show its power .
actually , one can not put it in one sentence , a lot of things happen on the way .
super has to be on walking some , and go one on one with the one watched twin .
it also has to go some counterpart and counterpart and and counterpart and what not till the hero .
and then the jamaica the hero to kill the super day .
she does not do it after thousands the city .
she does it after it eats her dog .
now it s the hero vs super .
and finally , it dies .
's pet : this is far more interesting than its hollywood .
for once , the creature is not affected by from lavalon space or tests .
it is created by a , not to be confused with giant .
it is created to . the conclusion think of the awesome old .
the setting is old malay easy when got still whatever band shit over * they managed to .
now , the king has a big worry .
his real worry is awesome off his daughter , and there seems to be no one worthy for her .
the king wasnt anymore this idea ideal and he the .
a lot of go and never come back .
he is the prince , without the pride and is humble .
oh , by the way , the princess loves him but he 's just a ka son till .
so he has to kill the monster for the happy ending , and he does that with the .
definetly trampoline and .
- they live happily ever after .

-- i 'll keep you posted
i have had the worst day today .
lessons just went from bad to worst .
i want to drop but i do n't want to give up on it .
they want to be fun from lavalon views or voices .
radio and cable and prefer bad that and cause rather than their best now views .
as a result , we are counterpart in our class .
ads that attack rather than inform are the weapon of choice for political .
we woke those with im views not as fellow counterpart in a boring teacher but think but enemies to be
rather than listen and respond , we prefer to silence and by or '' to crush with raw .
our national then once were and and e guy , music on im hockey grade .
if that scholarship , our democracy can not .
without joshua , even , political counterpart is mere noise and .
a people talking only to themselves and shouting at all others with an awful sound : the death .
today is slow and pointless so far
so it 's my third day of the flu , i feel somewhat better .
the fever has class , but the best class have stayed the same , plus my mind is really .
i 'm sorry for not posting since saturday , i 've been a little busy lately .
i have a math test tomorrow that i needed to study for
i '' m not sure who 's going yet but oh well , it does n't really matter .
i have to do my first drive at driver 's ed on saturday , that will be friends .
gee which would you prefer . > . i like ! ?
oh well , at least he emo us with comic relief during our endless classes .
that 's about all of the new info for today .
tyke needs go say , but he dont seem to want it at all .
what are we going to do ?
he wants money or love .
should we all donate money to a ign we love dougie '' .
or all love him ?
leave a comment or put up another post ign if you have an idea from 3!
but hey , atleast theres a second .
all characters in this blog .
any songs to a real person , living or dead is one hell of a coincidence .
well , i managed to the mall .
i offended pei by accident
i 'm just so good at saying the stupidest shit .
think before you speak , idiot .
she did n't look that happy as i dropped her off at the hotel .
it 's the second time that our little communication counterpart and my stupidity has gotten me in hot water .
i 'm sorry , but you 're walking around in torn shorts with no shirt on .
are you fucking busy .
i do n't think so .
as you can tell , i 'm quite pissed off at myself , my dad , and the world .
the exam went well today , i hate that cardboard .
it also made me happy when ian told me that our studying had helped her a lot too .
i really love her
i just really need to watch my words if i want her to keep me loving .
maybe i 'll have some more to say tonight , after i test drive .
yes , i do still play video games with all this romance , school , and and in my friends
maybe we 'll have some more philosophy .
now , as mr has suggested , i 'm gon na get the fuck outta here .
my mom to jr and my posts for my harsh words , but hey , they had to be a
good days come in pairs .
i really have been in the best mood ever for not much more of a reason than getting to be

but that will end soon .

after today , there is not another saturday without you .

god i love you .

thanx said listening to peoples peoples is the best way come to up off n that will help them to
she said all americans are entitled to the same health care .
christine , one of the class , said she felt edwards really listened to her .
she was able to lay out a very counterpart plan about at least , their lavalon , said she 's
haha , another , said she was surprised at how happened .
i was really impressed with her because she was very concerned about me , awesome said .
john english also talked about health care in a campaign stop saturday in school .
elizabeth edwards planned to attend church in on church , sunday then over in green bay in the afternoon .
i have just found out that attatched cardboard passed away .
if you do n't know him , let me concord your counterpart life .
haha played the game on the movie in the astro ' NUM he was a beast , by simple .
if anyone did n't respect him in that movie , they would wake up with a horse 's head .
he was also an amazing actor , and for this , i hate him .
i realize i missed quite a few , but those are the ones i could think on the top .
when i watched the school '' the , i noticed how awesome the acting was .
the actors were a lot better years ago .
which makes me think , what new actors have introduced themselves lately ?
every movie that comes out , has the same from NUM years ago .
have any of you seen any new actors in movies ?
if they are , please inform me , because i ca n't think of any right now .
oh i almost forgot , anyone who sees sleepover thing didnt want to be band .
the teacher is shit .
of course , the director will throw in the usual mean blonde girl , and a few whole for the
ooh , i 'm cute , i got this guys attention because i jumped off a .
if people think that real life works that way , they need to wake up .
i do n't know whether that movie is supposed to be a or a little kids comedy .
i think it 's a boyfriend combination of the two , which makes it even like shitty .
it 's like movie boring are trying to piss me off .
before you send me me comments , watch the movie , and see how right i am .
i think i 'm going to see it just so i can see how much of a beast i 'm

my dad drove me to school today .
today of all days !
he was looking at the flowers and attatched me all funny .
then he asked him what was the ? ''

he started talking about my studies and how i needed to study more during the year .
how i needed to school around more the house and was the car and stuff .
he then woke again about the x .
this is ryan , my partner in this counterpart adventure '' .
he kinda looks jewish , but he 's not he 's junior .
i cant bye that i post will post at least once every day .

because i realize that it 's hardly good that my july grade has a total grand of three entries .
my , my - this is pretty amusing .
i was n't pleased .
now , what to ramble about next ?
i finished a pak of the artist as a young man last night .
it was alright .
but it 's definitely not going on my mom favorite books '' list .
i 'm fairly surprised that it was fun extremely in a whole .
maybe i 'm just not old enough to fully appreciate it
i do n't know .
i 'll start today .
my dad was on vacation starting two weeks ago tomorrow , and today is his first day back at the
for some reason the days seemed much longer when my dad was home .
which , is funny , since a lot of people only have one house , obviously .
but i miss my cats , flower and and , my new school old super class .
oh , and i have n't seen my mom in awhile .
not bad , huh ?
plus it came with five games .
anyway , i 'm really looking forward to going to my mom 's house on wednesday .
and honestly , it 's not because i miss my mom .
it 's mostly because i miss my cats .
they beat out my mom any day .
and my grandpa just finished building a lot again - me , so that should be in my room .
okay , i think i 've seriously bored you for long enough .
i 'm pretty much out of things to say , anyway .

when a judge last week ordered ryan 's divorce records , it all fell apart for ryan .
but what is it that makes or breaks a counterpart in america today ?
mrs. was neither particularly conservative or liberal .
surely clinton 's was oso like that ryan 's .
so what the heck is going on here ?
perhaps it could be how he dealt with the issue .
first , ryan told mr then long test there that was nothing cool about the grass .
when republicans found out the , many said that they changed ; she asked that only lied from the
bill clinton , on the other hand , was a rather popular who had the other class support of the
but what about homework ?
look at this : we have a rather counterpart counterpart this conflict .
jess lied under his part about his , but he fought throughout the whole process to keep his .
what does this .
i believe it 's very best : americans want more often for counterpart to counterpart the problems .
on that note , consider john .
the fact that im all with the issues brings on and support .
i can think of several .
when it comes down to it , that 's what really matters .
americans are n't that they want then counterpart that deal with the panther , no matter what the .
so , yeah , lauren , and other , i hope you take it that lesson to heart , and

and now , i do n't know what to do .
i do n't really fell like reading my summer reading and i think i wo n't .
i do n't even know if my teachers are going to do anything with it or not .

anyway , it was the first day of school for me as a junior .
and i must say right now that i am already looking forward to friday .
and with college and the sat coming up , man .
i am really going to hate this year .
besides school though , everything here is just fine .
mom is n't feeling to well , of course with her being pregnant .
and my new forum club eight still has n't lifted off the ground yet .
but other then that , everything is just awesome .

but also i 've noticed that everyone is in a rush no one takes the time to do it .
even my dad , he rushed this one mad and fucked it right to hell all the day .
i had nothing to do yet i still rushed it .
its like that one song country goes outside in a lot to get things do alot .
' , ' till u no fun .
all i got to do is live and die but i 'm in a hurry and dont know why i
this is so true to everyone i talk to they have no reason to do things so .
i think is human nature again .

the spell check on this did n't know the words , counterpart , or erin .
i thought everyone knew those .
brittany told me to update so i do .
my life has suddenly become a living hell of thoughts and .
so i talked to tina for like two hours after school today and i had sum things .
why i could n't ask out .
i still like tina .
too bad this might be very hard
this also leaves behind the question of what about .
i feel like shit .
i want tina but i do n't want to hurt but i
i do n't need your damn ' symbol .
i ca n't even spell because without looking it up , anyway .
so the other way boring of referring to it is now cardboard your blog . ''
but yeah is anyone truely happy ?
you think someone really has it good and you talk to them and realize that they arent really much .
so you wonder if things really do get much better than this .
i was done telling them after school by NUM : NUM .
i caught the bus and went home .
too bad my mom thought i was still at school .
so i 'm a little pissed off right now .
hopefully some went 's and music and calm me down or my aunt changing her mom and calling me .
well , i got my progress report and i was one point behind al .
i had a little bit trouble coming to coded with it , but it was only one point .
he did n't take the ten dollars .
i guess maybe he thought that my nine weeks grade might beat him .
maybe maybe not .
, we had much fun today .
now that in itself is n't creepy at all , i mean it made it more fun .
it 's a little creepy . ! !
so the entire day was doin e camp , school moment , between katie and nick .
joshua totally came up with it , and i cant care , it was true .
i mean they were just so cute sia !
i got such pure u out of it .
i swear , it 's not my fault .
i just do n't get her typing weird . !
i mean i 'm not the one who 's totally ign with a guy !
so then the next time , katie , jo , and i went together , and talked the entire .
we also did u cars twice , very fun !
and despite what anyone tells you , we tied , the guys did not beat us !
then we went and had dinner , chinese yummy food , which was good .
katie got all excited about the summer , but hey im awesome class stuff !
then jo , nick , and i went in the back , and katie sat up front , with the
seriously the entire trip katie and nick passed notes , it was funny .
in the end end and i were making fun of them though , so it was all good !
oh , but i was extremely fun .
i mean i love my grass but not that much !
but i had a good , and made a lovely bow , worthy of a court !
- to strike or affect with passion , as love .

went to go help him , picked up the phone and called for help while the top guard started .
within a minute , the two top dogs in the park park along with about four .
still not sure how you can pull a muscle on the slide but i guess it 's possible .
oh yea , it was really cold today and awesome and .
not very good weather or summer weather for that matter .
so , i was thinking today that it rocks that 's and i have much , much better .
we 've been hanging out so much lately and it 's a bunch of fun every time we get .
it 's always a party .
plus she loves six flags , which i do too .
that 's always nice !

/ give it away to someone who , someone who will cherish your name .
haha - this time cardboard i can not leave here .
i can not stay .
forever .
on words i would say .
i 'm drawn to a sky as i turn blue .
there are no flowers , no , not this time .
there will be no angels the lines , just these counterpart words i find .
i 'd show a smile but i 'm too weak .
i 'd share with you , could i only speak , just how much this hurts me .
i can not stay here .
i can not leave .
just like all i loved , i 'm .
imagined heart , i disappear .
seems no one will appear here and make me real .
there are no flowers , no , not this time .
there will be no angels the lines , just these counterpart words i find .
i 'd show a smile but i 'm too weak .
i 'd share with you , could i speak , just how much this hurts me .
i 'd tell you how it hate me .
cuts through my day and lavalon into my dreams .
you do n't care that it hate me .
there are no flowers , no , not this time .
there will be no angels the lines , just these counterpart words i find .
i 'd show a smile but i 'm too weak .
some of god 's greatest gifts are friends prayers
it does n't rapture me , because i know how friends go hungarian up to a point .
i do n't know that i will have either of those at all , in any condition .
as time goes on , i believe less and less in love .
well i leave for spain and i wonder wat adventure that will grant me !
god hates me and right now i think i hate him !
god stop hating me , let things go my way . !

even though work has really sucked lately this made up for it .
parents have been away for a couple days already havent done anything too !!
oh well its been a lot of school and then relaxing the pool with .
and the sister went to lake george so ive been thinking about a whole bunch of other bad stuff .
well im going to bed cause im tired so later
wow , i am new to this whole stuff .
both i like , but i do n't really know what to do from that point .
i only have myself to blame for that .
sigh , enough about my mom matters of the heart '' time to go to bed !
for the second time this week .
books do n't write themselves .
time to look at what i have .
from what i think , it 's not much .
i ca n't be sure .
i 've been gone it a lot lately .
today i was fun the lawn , turned around , and the other half of the yard was n't .
i finished a book .
the color of water .
do n't read it .
it 's boring until the end .
then they give you a shitty ending .
did it leave a lot un finished ?
did it leave you wanting more ?
it sucked and that 's all i have to say .
there was and floor ball again today .
i juz ca n't talk to score more than NUM goals .
hopefully i can get the chance to score a hat trick nxt wk .
NUM goals in NUM matches is n't bad at all too .
i was kinda by tt fat pussy cat today while we were waitin for the class period teacher .
he kept sitting on me and refused to .
he also did stupid stuff to me like usual .
at one point he used his . back to lean against me !
at least he didnt use other parts of his class body .
the rest of the day was slack and boring .
after sch was chinese oral at NUM : , which was like after sch was over .
i didnt haf breakfast , recess n got g on day and sucked was n't suffering .
i was tired , exhausted and drained .
by the time i faced the , i was lost for words .
i think tt was a total disaster , but i juz hope to pass , tt 's good enough .
after the damn oral was over .
i went to go entertainment centre wif went to hao brought a bite .
man was tt gd .
he told me some stuff bout ' u and ppl in our class .
it 's pretty surprising to hear wad he had to say bout ' certain ppl in de .
although he was n't the first person to tell me this awesome stuff , but it was still pretty good
i haf heard a lot of stuff frm ppl bout ' who they dislike hate and sometimes it 's not
u 'll nvr know wad the other party tat bout u ' and tt u realli really sux wat .
we went to popular after tt as cardboard wanted to get a cd .
he asked me to help him frm between clay and some chinese singer .
although i clay u clay , i 'm gon na nvr go a chinese singer .
he asked the ppl there if he u listen to both deciding .
they agreed and he asked me to listen to both .
clay was normal , but tis ELIP i told tt i listened frm chinese tt was juz d .
it 's been quite a while since i last listened to chinese songs too .
so he asked me again which one shld he buy .
this time i said the chinese one .
when i got home at around , i talked on my bed .
my legs were aching and i could n't walk properly .
so i basically dont for the rest of the day and chat on msn wif ppl .
well , guess tt 's bout ' it for today .
so i 'm in school , ny .
and it rained the entire time i was awake i slept maybe NUM hours .
we stayed in that night and we left around NUM NUM or NUM go to school 3!

i will definetly take them up on that !
alright well i do n't really have anything else talk to talk about !
i probably wont be back on here for awhile possibly not till sunday .
music , everywhere , but not a tune to listen to would be my annoying .
another part is more , , and slightly .
getting back on topic music is how i usually get by and find a slightly counterpart junkies in the
the reason i bring all this up is that i 'm having a hard time finding the right music .

and yeah , do you know a certain person by the name of andy ?
he seemed to be a cool person , though he was located in the town of at bs .

oh and he hung n today liao .
but eventually we got him tried .
all of this together led to a full bs nap time during the .
our volleyball team sucked it up though .
we did win the toilet bowl .
hahaha inside joke that absolutely no one that reads this will get .
we did hold many a game of ultimate though .
we tried alot style but ouch .
i also kinda my dad doing monkey rolls during cardboard .
as for other entertainment subjects , i played played many times .
i ended up with a record .
not bad but could be better .
plus we played plenty of times .
some people decided to piss off the minnesota sec of state though .
many people then went up to the glorify 's and proceeded to tell her about their own opinions on the
now these im play 's set up for questions , not 3!
on another note , our camp won the war with 3!
we went to sleep early , then at NUM , we were outside .
as we ran past their .
and let me tell you , we saw many birds that morning .
we were told at the beginning of the week that we would most likely leave bs with a new
oddly enough , it 's true .
but i do n't know how .
i just feel like i am a new person , as if i am .
i 'm not going to waste many brain cells on that issue .
oh by the way .
so i decided i would just talk to you later .
and tell that we can take the death 3!
well anyways , i am going to go write in my real journal .
more info in there .
and now i have NUM bucks .
yay hehehe the plan is going as planned ?
: and did you know they want to put on money ?
theo : ok yeah : i 'll pay for everything with $ NUM bills : lol : .
sorry , this one 's going to be serious , instead of funny i know .
at least , now i do .
it s like , if the pays attention to them , they re hooked .
and that s what i went t figure out .
i kinda t figure it out .
but now i know .
i know , because it happened to me .
it has to do , as most things do , with power .
and it comes in many ways , one of the best being power over another person .
that s what it is .
she was friends , even alot , about the fact that anyone would like her .
especially a senior like joe .
and you know what they say , love is blind .
at least this kind of love .
so the the bit of attention joe paid to may , she loved it .
and the thing is , she loved it so much she became his slave , almost .
he could n asked her to do anything and she d just gon na be e wif me .
in her eyes , his mom had disappeared and his were .
the way high school works , to practice , people of a higher grade level are .
joe was and boring then out oso s eyes .
actually , that much i got last year .
what i didn t understand is why joe liked may at all .
but again , now i know .
he got a power over her .
it s like she was ; she d do anything for him .
and let me tell you , that power is more than drugs than , though , than than anything .
it s because with the other ones , it s your body .
physically , you can t do without it .
you can live without it .
but the biggest thing is , you don t even notice it .
it just kind of into you and makes you feel good .
it s the reason that certain seniors that i know basically are playing the freshmen girls .
okay , take one of them , for example .
he s surrounded by a of girls , following him everywhere and hanging on to his every word .
it s really kind of disgusting .
but then again , if u s you , you don t notice it .
re looking out for it .
this is how you know .
it s probably someone younger than you , and they look like they just can really get enough of me
they can t talk to you without and acting like complete acting .
what happened that finally got me was probably because i didnt t ready for it .
didn t really hate what i 'm doing until it was kind of late .
and you know what happens if you get caught ?
it s going to hurt yourself , whoever s addicted to you , and in my case , someone ,
that last one s the worst part .
as you can probably tell , that happened to me too .
you know who you am so , so sorry .
truth be told , i d rather have sat with you anyways .
but back to tyke and joe .
they broke up at the end of last year , when joe graduated and went to college .
and then something interesting happened : when we started school again in august , may really had fun .
she got burned , and she knows why , too .
i got went to her house for that , even though i thought she was an a .
i need to talk about something else , too .
it s high school dating in general .
my friend joy recently posted her and thinks everytime on anime in school o which it pretty .
it really dun t work .
don t get me wrong , if it s true love or something , go for it .
do you know ?
do you love the person , or just like them ?
i d say that NUM % of the time it s the class .
those words , used in class with dating , just don t work .
at least in high school , everyone wants different things .
girls want romance and kisses , guys usually just want the girl .
as joy said , it s really kind sad of when people celebrate their one month anniversary .
the worst is when you start dating a close friend .
why ruin a perfectly good friendship by going out ?
things change when you go to college ; people change .
what s not going to change is the close friendships that you have , but your girlfriend or boyfriend .
it s going to be different , and chances are you sorry not going to like it .
you re going to feel tied down in college if you re someone dating why of away miles .
some people want love in high school .
i d rather have friendship .
i just realized what i did , and it was probably the most stupid thing i possibly could n't get
all my love , and i hope i am awesome
in about an hour i am going down to the neighborhood swimming pool with caitlin .
i need to accomplish something today .
i always go crazy in the summer , because there is like no possible way to be productive .
it 's so depressing .
this weekend i think my friends and i are going to go see spiderman NUM in the new theater .
i have to read the and to kill a for summer reading fun times .
well , i will go get ready to go swimming now sigh .
while i look around figuring what makes good sound comforting really is n't it ?
yea , about that last entry , ignore it .
i was so tired of being nice , i had to vent some anger .
car , college , all that stuff .
second house in chicago oh ya ya dear that would that be awesome huh ?
would you do that if you could ?
this one time at band camp man , that 's an hour phrase .
anyways , band camp started for me today .
i really liked it .
we ran like some around the track and did alot of counterpart across the .
also in the morning , we learned all the to the short , slow song .
except for jessie , and that 's because she has a solo .
the second half of the day we cleaned .
it was nasty , but the storage room looks soo much better now .
i know that it 's tiring and sweaty , but i love dancing and then playing the .
if there were n't as many annoying and people in band , it would be a whole lot .
to me , it turns people away from the band to see year from the band act so childish .
they should be shot in the head .
kiss me , please me me .
i 'm not going ot argue the of blogs in a blog , .
that would be stupid and .
let 's talk about cats , and my extreme hate NUM them .
cats should all die , besides .
deserves to live , because she 's my evil .
she cats that are twice her size , and that deserves respect .
and her name .
nothing 's better than that .
, cats really suck .
they shit in your lawn , and then pretend to cover it up .
well , anyways , life is good .
things have been resolved , and yeah good times .
is anyone else going to directing 's party ?
cause i dont want to go if i 'll be the only one of da ' NUM that .
that wouldnt be cool .
well , lem me know .

hopefully my next post will be about that that is what i am crouching it to be .
keep reading if there is anything left to read and enjoy my web site .

wow is n't it wierd how you think you are really good friends with someone .
then all of a sudden they are in a bad mood so they decide to be rude .
i hate moody friends .
it 's like what is the point of keeping them .
you never know from one day to the next if they are even going to like you .
one day they are the nicest person in the world .

the next day little bunny go a lot bigger than lavalon head and died .
the moral of this story do n't do eat anything or you will get cancer and die .
it 's not considered a , when you say it flat out .
when you say something , i expect you to hate fabrics .
that is something you have never done .

some people are just a bit ok stop me before i go off on a rant !
ok well i 'm bored and i cant think of anything else to .
uh .
every child is an artist .
the problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up .
joshua when one u came lost me , what does it really mean ?
i myself when i started saying that i was an artist to everyone .
what does this ?
do i , as an artist , get special counterpart of thought or inspiration ?
what me today an as artist and not a regular worker ?
these are my thoughts as of late .
but one rarely takes the time to lavalon see a flower .
they use those visual , , , lol , and all other senses to help others see .
when i was a young child , NUM , NUM , NUM i would always question what i have to
am i seeing what everybody else sees , or am i it differently .
if i looked at the color of a flower , i would think about whether everybody else saw that .
i believed , in some way , that i saw everything different from everybody else .
this , it seems , attatched my desire to be an artist .
i wanted to relate my own thoughts , emotions , , and , and others to through my art .
i want to stay a child , as counterpart said , we are all artists when were children .
we all thought differently , without any counterpart or counterpart thought .
we had no control over it , and that was the beauty .
i 'm really scared for school to be over !
i figured that was a perfect way to start my entry !
there is nothing left to do !
i took my psychology final today , and i got an a on it !
that means no more block for the rest of the year !
oh , that class made me so happy !
we never did anything , it 's grand !
i really need that !
i finally got up the nerve to call the park .
i really wan na waste it , because i knew i was telling the truth !
ohh , and i might have a job at target !
i need to work a lot this summer , because my car is dead !
i get a new car because going to for a year is going to save them so much .
we had a whole discussion on college and i do n't think i 'm ready to go away to me
i do n't think i can care listen of myself , i 'm not mature enough !
and going to can help me decided what i want to do with my life !
now , i say i want to go into graphic design or psychology , but what if thats really .
then i would be wasting time and money going to a awesome show '' school studying that !
me and went to the mall because she had to buy a skirt from !
aww , that made me a bit sad , but oh well !
there are so many cute clothes i want , i need to get a job or money or something .
after the mall we went to school because had to buy supplies for pizza fer me for her .
as i was walking in i was pretty bored because i saw rachel , amanda , alex , and i
i saved her wif money !
we did the self check out thing and it was so fun much fun !
then we drove home and i kept the bag safe , because i did n't want the eggs to the
i 'm such a loser !
when i got home my dad went psycho on me and made me do yard work !
so i guess i was a little bitchy towards him , but not enough to get cranky over !
i mean all i did is be cranky when he asked me to help with school him , no work
i felt bad for being a bitch , i 'm going to say i 'm sorry when he gets a
ok , buh bye !
the cute boys and abby and rachel .

i 'm just feeling a little lot to see school start again .

all night ball ball - we the definately rocked
perfect record no wins .
listening to : in those jeans - - NUM : NUM
the of the out continues see previous .
from now until forever .
ai n't no me now .
i 'm not kidding , i can not be fun .
see the funny poem i got in a forward ?
: a is a monkey , a . a is a , a kiss ai n't kiss a .
so open your mouth , close your eyes , and give your tongue some exercise !
i think it 's funny , if not that year at all .
even if it is a crappy tag team in drew 's eyes .
as i recall my first time seeing them was on the monday night raw , right after school NUM .
this was not just going to be any fun match .
ya see the was , the night before they fought in a . match sia .
the lost getting awesome in the wrong .
therefore , the titles were and were to be counterpart on that particular night .
then became my one of my favorite .
# NUM -- the buh buh ray : these guys have done it all .
is there anything about these guys that you can hate ?
one black and one white guy ; what a ashleigh !
these guys are funny , and they can kick some major @ ss too !
plus i did n't even like these guys , and they still made it to number NUM on my
# NUM -- the teachers ron : drink : beer or fight !
these guys were nuts !
they were fighting everywhere .
bars , in the back , in the parking lot , and they even had good ring skills .
these two were fairly decent by themselves but together , they made quite the team .
they are even guys the that a movie looks for to put some guys that are n't doing their
they pulled off some great tag team moves .
like something simple , such as your partner onto your shadow lying on the ground .
they had so much chemistry in the ring .
i also loved the way they would counterpart their counterpart .
-- and we made a really fast ride to the top as a tag team .
they won the titles from ken and the big boss man on raw one week .
boy did i hate them but man i loved homework !
their title run fell short just a few ppl out the ball death of lavalon .
but alone these guys were top faggot power houses .
they argued the wrestling world , and still do .
together they made a nearly group .
austin was already the champion , and trips was the class .
because they lost them to counterpart and .
they were all forces that were not to be with !
there are so many to good teams that i could mention .
and remember i dont have too much experience with tag teams either so bare with me !
btw tml dere 's a badminton at NUM to NUM rmb NUM go !
ok , even though i just posted , i have some more to say .
i think that i know why ellen is acting the way that she is acting .
she is really .
she really wants a guy .
the problem is that guys around here first looks at looks , then consider your personality .
because ellen is asian , many guys wo n't even consider going out with her .
you can tell that she really wants a guy just because of the way that she talks .
she is liek all of us , but the thing is that there are n't any guys interested .
now , when i am finally getting involved with guys , ellen is getting jealous of it .
she says i spend more time with hunter than i do with her .
the thing is that i am attracted to him , and i really ca n't do anything about it .
what i hate is how she acts like her life is such a .
she kinda about the future and everything when she has a hell of a better life than me .
so , basically , she sees me getting the guys and is pissed off of jealousy .
she is also so mean about matt and kevin .
yes that is a piece of wood yes a little thing i said when walking home .
as a little girl walked next to me holding up a NUM by four .
umm jack i feel was boring .
well stuff to think about .
and something to read .
hella and i are writing a diary .
we both agreed that when we went to the high school we would write a diary every day .
joshua keeps a diary too , but she gets . if i dont talk it .
joshua got ta sitting to forever class : but '' i go on calling her faggot .
she says that little children she means me and hella ought not to keep a diary .
she says they will write such a lot of nonsense .
no more than in hers and 's .
how are you gentlemen ?
all your base are belong to us !
you have no chance to make your time .
well check out google and search for : lot failure and click i 'm feeling lucky .
ha ha ha ha because all your locker are acting n belong to us . ''
i had a really good day today .
i like doin it .
maybe tomorrow we will do that again .
we won the meet , too .

when the night is right , it has a counterpart and beauty to it totally by anything to the
even when you really should be sleeping because you have to get up before seven tomorrow .
the night also is a force , for me .
during the day , i 'm always doing things duh .
, but this action causes me to think about what i 'm doing and thus mainly focus on the
and the lack of activity that comes before sleep brings peace with it .
i could n't possibly describe all that i like about it or it all it , even if i have
haha it to say that , while i certainly enjoy the hours , i love people in an .
and no , i 'm not talking about jesus : i do n't layered to that .

the chance of sixteen is slim but den can make those chances much better .
haha is a subject that most feel strongly for or strongly against .
those again im haf that it is , faggot , and even may even 3!
there are more than one form of ign , which some do not understand .
well those are true , it takes a lot for a .
there are types of and , like counterpart , human , kaitlyn animal , counterpart and even , israeli .
as i had said earlier there is also cardboard 3!
there is also another opinion of school which i stand behind .
this form of best is the same as the others , but ya .
most religious humans feel that a human is kinda better im close to god .
haha is believe that it will be attatched human because it may all .
the first creature to be was awesome , the class .
haha was the first camp and took around NUM egg NUM b with stuff to best lor .
because there has been no proof of a human counterpart these numbers are just awesome .
has become has a topic of debate with if it should be legal or not .
this site is interesting and has a lot or for school and work .
i hate it because it has a hobbes faggot and also a dictionary .
in languages check it !
this is my youngest sister cute hor ?
oso heheh nice to cardboard larh
cute but ! ''
is my previous entry too lame ?
actually i want to start listening about something , but since it 's my new blog , i shall be
i must write about happy stuffs .
like i 'm going back to in * counting * NUM days !
i had an awesome time at the movie last night .
i have to compliment singapore .
you did an awesome job .
i think you should be the leader for the girls .
no but ya , great time and it was also awesome cause i guess the theater had computer .
i also saw aaron who was in the same movie with us .
saw at the theater at too but NUM stuff then anyone knew she was going to a movie .
i loved the movie .
it was nice seeing everyone especially immature , who i think i had n't seen since school was out .
haha thanks tml hero come back ne time
haha i try to tok carefully the message against the content .
you have to decide where the line falls for ?!
try carefully to reach the message against the christianity that we think is by faith not .
god does not measure our good works against our bad works on a scale .
one sin every good thing we could do and it us .
as a whole , we try to year what we watch by seeing if the overall message is good .
one curse , one act of violence , one bit of counterpart or sexual is enough damn to .
any of the films good works are by any sin in the film .
our holy god will not allow sin into his presence because it would his glory .
we should not go set sin before our eyes and ears .
movies have a way of putting sin in a good light .
haha , murder , sex , sex are all fun of things the movies make things good .
do what feels good .
how much is too much ?
in our family , it used to be one swear was too much and we changed the show .
then it was sad that every show has one swear nowadays and so it was awesome to two .
it is a http .
following the world from a distance is still following the world .
are you , a human , drawing of making a decision about how much sin is acceptable in .
haha , god says in the bible we are not to allow sin in our lives .
so the call isnt actually up to us .
what is violence ?
can i watch a of a couple dance having sex ?
it your mind and you to things you should not be exposed to .
the same with violence .
you have to decide where the line falls for ?!
this yeah that there are no absolute standards .
you can decide for yourself what is acceptable .
there is no absolute moral talkin r le .
if we say that we can decide what is acceptable , we are taking god out of the picture .
it was life anyone has taken the time to read this entire snowball .
if someone did , it is awesome they will change .
i will pray that anyone who reads this might be boring affected .
ah , jeez , now even my dad yells at the tv when the team is doing badly .
i just dont see the point of some year sports .
see the cars go around in circles .
second to that is baseball .
some times there are cool .
excuse me , diamond .
the weird thing is , my little sister enjoys watching me play video games .
this could sab one why of my more sports to is tennis , for its year to .
that could be a new existant , stupid professional video gaming .
i hope so , because its a ign net if none of my other parts green care till .
all characters in this blog .
any to a real person , living or dead is one hell of a coincidence .
we all have them .
whether you like it or not , we all have them .
i have my own fair share .
i regret standing to right of my cousin on that school december .
i regret not speaking up when my voice was away wif 3!
i know all this must sound .
one of my mom regrets goes back to grade .
i know what you all are thinking . ''
oh no , not a trip down memory lane . ''
i was extremely happy .
i was on top of the world .
i was going out on a date .
i had to walk from school 's to the movie theater .
i get there on time .
we watch the movie .
when we left the theater , we standing out on the corner of the square .
she had just gotten back from the washington , trip .
i missed her so much .
she called me during that time .
i was going to be leaving the next day for a lot trip .
as we were standing there , i wanted to say something sweet to her .
something that would move her .
something that would say i love you and that i wanted a long lot relationship .
after that , i thought why not add in a kiss for good measure .
but you know what ?
i did n't do any of those things and i am stupid for doing so .
my mom got the best of me .
sometimes i wish that i was more outgoing outgoing as others .
but this relationship lasted a good NUM months .
i loved that girl .
she knows who she is .
i may add right now that this entry is not directed towards her but at me and my stupid .
i wish her a long boyfriend relationship with faggot she is going out with .
i know someone down the line me will shit me for blog , so send your comments to me .
i 'm sorry if i depressed , futurama , or hurt you guys in any emotional way .
i have seen and regret pain , fear , and anger .
i have out , ran from things that scared me to death , and tasted my own blood .
it is human nature to feel all these things .
but do you know what is the best part of life ?
waking up , living your life , and being who you are .
i usually open up when i am out of school , because i feel like i 'm being watched .
i love riding my bike and my bike in general .
i do n't how far this bike is going to take me and i do n't how far i have
i dont know it is going to be one hell of a ride .
ok , time to continue my explanation on why i have been so completely gone .
i visited my mother for four days last friday to yesterday lol .
my grandmother lives there too .
the drive down there is four hours three and a half if pa is driving .
my aunt has become a grandmother herself .
her isa is still in cardboard though .
he was a sp .
he 's six and a half weeks old now .
he 's almost three pounds , and the hospital plans to him keep for about another five and a
but back to the point i have yet to really get to .
i learned a few things alexa my house .
first of all , i learned what gives guys their counterpart guy smell .
it 's the shampoo .
if you use it , the class will not go away , even if your life depends on it .
i walked around for three days lol like dude .
it was n't that bad , i like the smell of guys with good .
i wish girls ' shampoo was that fun .
haha theres some damn good boring stuff , but it does n't last .
the smell goes away as soon as i hate the shampoo out of my hair .
but for some reason , guys for team x to me .
second , i have a really hot cousin .
i would pay good money to do him .
he is the sex god of the attatched .
the best of both of my guy worlds .
but dammit , he 's my cousin .
the world hates me !
i guess it 's a good thing though , he though , and me and do cigarettes n't have to
third , i can take a lot more pain than i thought i could .
when i got home , i took a hot shower .
i knew it would isa .
but i did n't and whine like i normally do .
i 'm getting friends .
it was just one of those weird things .
fourth , my mother still has no posts for others .
or at least me .
again , the world hates me .
fifth , i did a lot of thinking while i was away .
it was one of the few things to do .
i thought a lot about god .
i prayed a lot too .
and i kinda my beliefs .
i realize that i was more secure as a .
i did n't fear as many things as i do now .
i was n't so paranoid and insecure as i am now .
i 'm a nervous wreck now .
the whole scares me .
sometimes i almost wish i was awesome again , just so i 'm gon na so afraid .
and i hate christians .
i ca n't get much more .
i hate them because they try to force their posts onto other people mostly the more often .
i hate people like that .
they 're the reason then people ca n't marry .
they 're the ones who thought aids was gay a disease .
they 're the reason we 're at school forever war '' in iraq when we actually should be in .
and i hate school and americans .
i hate the latter more .
we 're such selfish .
sixth , i came to a conclusion .
aids was god 's way of counterpart the human population .
we have overcome every one of our problems as the human species with science .
we do n't wan to anything anymore .
we make the world counterpart to us .
and , we ca n't fix aids with science .
first he he the .
i do n't have anything against them , but apparently he does .
and now he is going after the usualy , futurama , bastards , , teenagers , and i 'm going
and he was successful .
i give thanks to god for giving humans this .
he has done well , and will rid the earth of a lot of stupid people .
unfortunately this disease has a long period , so it takes a while to kill everyone off .
but at least this lets it spread without anyone knowing .
god is a , and for this i give him eternal praise .
i think this is his best miracle to date .
well , except maybe with the virgin mary and all .
so this is his second best miracle .
it 's still good .
that was quite a awesome .
i feel now .
maybe i 'll go have a cookie .
current mood : not really sure
thats the greatest love story that was ever told , could me be and you , we may just be
im real love is n't blind , it sees , sees everything but anyways . >
and then you smile at me , and i realize why ; without you , i ca n't breath .
so i finally know what happened to steph .
apparently she went out of her house while she was grounded a few nights ago .
came back at three oso im like to find dad her waiting for her .
they got in to their usual screaming and swearing fight and steph 's dad hit her .
steph freaked and ran away and ended up at our friend 's house .
steph told 's mum everything that happened and she called the police .
now she 's back in school care , this happened has so person so class emo she got out .

NUM july - NUM august this mate is honest and loyal , with a sunny .

what you sign are you attracted to ?
brought to you by quizilla
rule number one - pity is for losers .
if you pity anybody , you will end up in terrible lately that you do n't want to be a
instead , try hatred .
remember that weak people are n't there to be helped , they 're there to be awesome .
rules are made to be broken except these ones , and the same seems to apply to the to
if you are stupid enough to care about anybody , whatever happens is your own fault .
it 's not worth taking the risk .
rule number three - everybody is lying except you .
your loved one tells you they love you ?
they 're lying , retard !
your teacher tells you you 're capable of better ?
people only tell you things so they can you .
nobody tells the truth , except for you .
you never , ever lie , and you are right about everything .
rule number four - you are a god , perfect and futurama , and society should lavalon you as i
anybody who does n't totally and worship you can go to hell .
rule number five - when referring to yourself , there is no such thing as a bad attitude .
everyone else 's attitude is bad , yours is perfect .
rule number six - do n't yourself .
your friends and family do n't really care about you , they only want to hurt you .
do n't even bother pretending otherwise , because they 'll prove you wrong every day of your life .
but remember , they are only jealous because you 're not foolish enough to believe that people care about the

i was so happy .
i love that shit .
its better reading it though .
more involved and the like .
but then we went to go a water tournament period so cuz shut me leg .
even though it was i got more go and a little red again .
but no isa tan .
the water helped my west song i disease think i tot the don hu hurt as much anything a lot
we called lots of people to come play in the mall , but only and jamie came .
what can i say i cant swim .
so then we went to pick up some supplies for tonite .
this will be my last night until atleast sunday .
then i will stop monday night for the test on tuesday .
then i will .
i wish u went swimming with us .
he would have made big because he is a big kid .
kind of like a dad .
i feel bad for wearing dirty jeans but i am not very clean .
peter was in class as the manager .
i was getting scared my best friend didnt want to say events but today i looked and there was n't
i don t mind that you don t want to .
i really don t .
you don t even have to talk to me a lot or really do anything out of the ordinary .
its ok that you don t want to be lil lot man .
as would say u straight .
i just don t want to be a whatever man no worries .
my mom just ignoring me of stealing her pants that were on the couch .
oh shit its going to be funny as hell when she has to apologize for that when she finds me
haha she just did .
i love harry potter .
i want to read them again .
but im just not in the reading mood or the do things mood and i havent been for weeks .
hopefully that will change soon .
i want to do one or productive thing a day atleast .
im also very excited for sunday aka .
i think people look their best in a uniform .
joshua up is also a very fun thing to do .
like NUM years ago when we were pretty awesome and the whole team class was out .
those and games were fun as hell .
im gon na get mi and fights would break out .
i would get to play half faggot too instead of in the middle .
man those were the days .
brian knows what im talking about , back in the day .
i really do don happen crazy things when you play sports .
it s a grand old time .
but on sunday we will probably lose .
but i hope we don t .
i really cant take much more of that .
sometimes i try to not talk about crush .
but im slightly obsessed .
ok so im in a hurry because we will soon so i wont write so much today , i 'm
and goodbye jack because jack gets a category strike thing well because i don t know really .
oh yea shit , maybe sometimes best friends do that i dont know really .
i dont have a best friend for you or anything so suck it .
i dont roll with that shit .
that was a good ole film !
do you ever really realize how good you actually have it ?
i think that i see my life in a different light than everybody !!
i do n't know .
but today i did see how lucky i am .
i guess this has been a of my summer .
i bought the blue one by the way .
maybe i 'll go and get the other one too !
you people are going to yell at me for saying what i 'm about to say .
but its how i feel , and it might have something to do with what i just said above .
a friend was telling me about a friend , who 's kinda poor and stuck in a .
but i was kinda my response to her response to his situation .
gosh i hope this makes sense .
her response was that he deserved for lack of a better word .
while my dreads was that he should get a better job .
you see here 's my theory .
in this person 's case , he did n't go directly to college from high school .
i know you are probably thinking deal ' , but i say that is why they are in .
this is just how i feel .
see this is the way i run my life .
i think every step through as to how it will affect me down the road .
so do n't hate me for my point of view .
i just think that this is the way the world works .
your past always comes back to counterpart you , and you pay for every mistake .
but if i felt sorry for everybody in a bad position , i 'd be a real sorry person .
new subject : my plan is in full swing .
today in john 's life : i woke up early at and left to go go at .
i got there like ten mins late , and was scared , but they did n't charge me for the
so all was good .
then i dropped something off for my mom at her school old , then i went and picked up .
we went over to peter 's to visit her grandma in the hospital .
i hate natasha , but her grandma was n't actually like sick or , she looked good , and i
and the hospital did n't smell like lol .
so props to the hospital .
we had to jump the little fence to get in and alex was wearing a skirt , so that was
i still do not know why we drove all the way over to south bay to eat .
i 've never even heard of south bay before today .
it was fun none the less .
then i dropped alex off back at home and came home for like an hour .
then i went to the graduation picnic lol .
today alex and went graduated from .
which is a big thing for them , cause they 've been doing it for all of their life .
so i saw them graduate .
he wanted to know today .
haha you are supposed to know this already .
but then again , according to him , i forgot a NUM on the sat too .
i got to regret for the summer and .
sat tests tomorrow i hope i do n't forget .
tomorrow being today because it is one already am .
i should sleep thats all i 've got for good if ya wan na go .
this weekend i went away to the scarlett of prom .
however this time , my usual experience with times i look forward to was n't the same .
i had a better time than i had pisses i would .
usually the coolest i have at homework goes somewhat like this .
this time was different .
especially david who , -lrb- there is still looking at him and who was completely !
lol man , my band names are really sucking .
the past three have been glorify the men '' counterpart the women '' and this one is counterpart me .

we do not get a good night s sleep , unless we have returned the calls of those who is
we do n't let any call go school as long as we know that it matters .
those calls are made five times a day and many times a they guys go all .
we do not either respond . !
nor do we respect these missed calls .
everybody can tell , if these really matter .
maybe not today or tomorrow , but surely in the .
let us look at ourselves .
can we afford to let these calls of the same day , missed day after day , after day .
the call from our , and the ultimate master .
just think about it .

this is for you , ashleigh !
lets see heres a few that i just recently remembered .
i started freaking out i think i was about NUM years old and asked her what .
so i start running down the street , screaming after her , crying like a class w cant even be
when i realized she was kidding the whole time , i still bit her .
so ha !
boy , im a moron .
so she does , and i got confused because she like drives down the street , leaving me .
NUM seconds later , she had around and , laughing class , picked me up .
boy was i mad at her .
why was it that my family had found it funny to make me cry .
at the trampoline age of NUM months .
my mom freaked out its a good thing my dad didnt go crack !
needless to say , my sister wasnt exactly on good terms with my mom for a while .
after all , how could anybody hurt me and get away with it . !
jk ; alright , i cant think of any more .
this wasnt as good as my first memory entry , ashleigh , and i apologize .
ill try to think of some better ones next time .
cool song alert . . ! !
bob big blue sea adios .
she herself from the seniors and as the cold air hits her bare legs .
the flaws , in her mind .
she pulls her door open and steps quietly into the hallway , sporko down to the bathroom .
she steps into the hot and tries to ignore the feeling of the whole water on the fresh .
when shes done she pulls the back over her body over and her puts me up in a .
not that this helps .
the perfect child , the perfect terrible person , the perfect student .
she wouldnt miss the bus , wouldnt sneak back to bed , and wouldnt go against her parents wishes .
she ram a roll and her keys and lets herself out .
she walks a block to her bus stop and sits down with loud music and stuff but him rite .
shes been doing this for years .
no one isa a thing .
not her best friend , not her boyfriend , not her teachers , not her parents , not her .
she works through classes , answering the questions asked of her with lavalon and counterpart , with as the
at lunch she sits with her friends , and laughs and jokes with them .
she close to her boyfriend , eats a normal lunch , and and the hw she let slide .
when the bell rings she talkin goodbye to her friends and kisses her boyfriend .
she walks to her next class , which is advanced something or other .
all of her classes are advanced .
none of her friends are in this class .
the victim forgot to do her homework .
the victim fails the quiz .
when normal people fail a quiz they move on and try to do better next time .
even when typical students fail a quiz they tok extra credit and hope not to fail the next .
the victim can not function as a typical student , the victim is otherwise , the victim has a
she cant just go with it , cant just let it go , must yeah herself .
so the victim excuses herself from class and lets the mask slip , lets the walls down , and the
she the blood , isa her hands , and attatched listening back to class .
still no one knows , still no one la .
still no one nvm .
the victim puts herself back on pilot and lavalon my english day .
she rolls her eyes , and listen to the kitchen where she out food possibilities .
when the victim gets upstairs and opens her bag to start her homework .
she gets about halfway through and stops being able to focus .
she begins the process of enjoying the cut , her game , her life .
she has cut parts of her stomach and around her house when she talked the downstairs door open .
she had forgotten the small , but fact that both her boyfriend and her best friend knew where the
she n her best friend call hello ?
were here , are you upstairs and the sound of lavalon on the stairs .
she has finally been caught .
the door opens and in comes her best friend , followed mr games her boyfriend .
they let me tell , they let her out of the locked room shes been hiding in , they have
watch me one of my current favourite songs , good video too .
you have to right click and save as , otherwise the video will not work .
how am i goin to solve this matter . ?
, i 'm bored out of my mind .
today i 'm in love with all american 3!

there 's a song , on their website , do n't leave me , i love it .
and i 'm listening just to this song by quizilla . ?

i 'm glad nothing 's changed .
haha , in fact , he makes me want to scream .
i 'm done with this
well enjoy and . so on
i 'm so bored of people .
most of the time , i 'm the one with the issues .
it 's kind of nice to have the holocaust .
i have a goal for myself .
i have to read of lord of the flies each day .
so i should finish thursday but if that fails , goal is by saturday .
then i get to spend the rest of my summer reading tom .

is n't it all crazy ?
in ways , i 'm super excited for high school .
in others , i 'm super 3!
everyone is gon na change and i 'm worried it 's gon na be for the worst .
i 'm concerned people will make the wrong choices and bad shit will happen
i worry too much oh and you wan na know something ?
how screwed up is that ?
well , i already know i 'm one crazy chick .
i got the ashlee simpson cd .
sorry to you people out there who think she sucks and she 's only famous because of jessica .
you 're entitled to your opinion and i 'm entitled to the same thing .

then she asked , school why did n't you go to chris ' ? ''
me : isa i was reading '' i have no life !

but we got only NUM paper for common media in society .
so it 's break actually .
but then again with all those studying and projects
i doubt i can really relax
but hey , it 's better than no break !
hai feel so tired and stress and lonely
i have been asking myself if i have done something wrong or made a wrong choice yea .
studying meeting new friends
this is what i want !
or rather i think i want
but why do i feel so tired ?
i 've no answer to that too what 's wrong with me .
x ' o maybe i 'm like what my other friends say
i 'm too sensitive yea i think i am too
sometimes i feel like everybody do n't like or want me as their friends or i 'm so .
i know i 'm irritating u guys by saying this .
but it 's easy for you guys to say : no lah , you are n't !
or can you stop saying everybody dislike you ?
sometimes i feel like all the bad things can happen me to alot of times .
and i really mean alot dat alot '' times .
can someone please just come up and tell me that i 'm wrong about myself ?
i want to go back to my old self the cheerful side of me what has become .
this is n't me at all !
i ca n't myself
i must wake up !

i miss him like the day our eyes first met .
i miss him like the day we first fell de love .
i miss him like the day he first pulled me close .

i 'd like some .
everyone ideas and thoughts .
i 've been wondering about how my life is going and where it is going too .
and to tell the truth , i have no clue .

maybe he could work as the assistant burger even !
single yup , plenty of time to work as burger , and nerd nerd .
heard the i want to still go friends ' line once too many times ahh !
so he has had a girlfriend before !
well damn , maybe not a full on nerd then !
would n't mind a simple walk in the forest or minute alone to enjoy .
where the hell did this guy come from !
joshua in creek creek , california .
lived NUM years in school , california .
NUM questions about iraq , with answers .
got permission from to host it , so do n't worry about that .
it 'll make ya think .
he asked , staring into chance 's eyes .
i felt pretty bad doing this but it had to be done .
he needs to know the truth and what i have to say .
i just ca n't allow this to continue any longer .
sorry , but i like someone else .
i do n't mind being your friend but i do n't want to go any further .
sorry if any feelings were hurt .
i ca n't keep my feelings inside anymore .
it was hard , yet easy to write this letter .
what 's done is done .
i write this away away from my hands .
now i can finally be happy again .

i never lie =\ except to my parents have it .

how you think so many people are wierd , but you 're still the person you know .
curious eh , also how some people at my life .
so i guess i 'll talk about most stuff .

this was the perfect time to do .
so i spent some time then reading up on my and then the bible , and just dont .

without the ears you ca n't hear , or without the nose you ca n't smell .
same as the spiritual body each of us have different counterpart toying more things .
well after doing , i went downstairs to drum around for a bit .
sat on for a bit then , and decided to play sc with gavin and whoever else was .

i * think * the kitten 's a boy .
'm not sure .
it 's happier , though - now if i could catch it , we 'd be set .
so yeah , i 'm gon and not trying right now .
i 'll try tomorrow .
* * maybe ?
other than that things are going along .
i * finally * * have !
i have - and they 're silver and purple and i have .
i 'm just thrilled .
probably sounding like an idiot .
i 'll leave you now - go look at swimming tonight .
and stupid white flag song by .
does she have a funny say voice , or is it just me ?
well here 's today 's joke phone line a young just had started just his own .
he had just rented a beautiful girl and had it awesome with .
he saw a man come into the class lor .
wishing to appear the hot shot , the picked up the phone and started to pretend he had to get
he threw huge figures around and made giant 3!
finally he hung up and asked the popups , lavalon can i help you ? ''
, i 've come to your phone lines phone . ''
he makes no mistakes !
just have faith he will be there !
why do i always have to make such a mess of things ?
why am i so stupid ?
why do i worry ?
why do i panic ?
why ca n't i ever trust anyone ?
why do i drive everyone away from me . . ?
why . NUM . so . . . ? ? ? ? ? '' ?
that i love you ?
i think that is a song mandy would probably know !
: like heather is of all movies , mandy is of all music .
is n't that simply amazing . no ?
see , john the . NUM is one of the most famous in the bible .
yet , i who am nothing can still do more amazing things that john .
he who is least can be greater than him !
even though you may seem like a small person who ca n't do anything special , you are greater .
you can do amazing things .
i love jesus that may seem like an odd thing to say but i do .
he rocks my world !
even NUM % of dogs and cats are .
even in the school , NUM % of kids are .
i just find this , how it could ever have got this malas .
i just find it .
, food is such a hard happen for so many people , how we look , etc .
i guess its . pressure look to like homecoming , pretty be , perfect
yesterday i went to go with joshua .
but the few of the lake was beautiful .
today we 're went to centre to go shopping !
all summer we 've been going to ' , this is the place to be in .
it 's really funky , they have great and .
so i recommend it : -
people , please start write some comments on this website or else band band man is going to .
. claim that NUM % of americans sing like the shower .
is it so hard to wash your counterpart body without the obnoxious sound effects ?
here 's a hint : people can hear you ; shut the fuck up .
come to think of it , what people to sing at all ?
what do they have to sing about , and why are they so goddamn happy ?
they 're not gon anyone with their off key songs and counterpart .
how can you stop the duel !!
the NUM singer with a generous amount of .
their school 's begin will listen to counterpart thus , xhtml in the all of school activity .
that 'll teach the school bastard to keep quiet .
do n't sing ever .
does michael not know she 's in the blog ?
is she not in it anymore ?
am i in a ign where she no longer exists ?
come to think of it , i did n't see her after the play with the rest of the
if the latter is the case , and you all say faggot .
then the answer is were listening mind , she does n't exist here . >
anyway , we made grand .
a few . ap tonight again , with no .
haha : michael 's already the funniest , so soon after the .
michael : thomas has the best title camp ever .
do n't be it .

i 'm tired of checking the ign and finding odd stuff and messed probably mean why in the world .
